ulysses by james joyce i stately plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed a yellow dressinggown ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air he held the bowl aloft and intoned introibo ad altare dei halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely come up kinch come up you fearful jesuit solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains then catching sight of stephen dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head stephen dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hair grained and hued like pale oak buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly back to barracks he said sternly he added in a preacher's tone for this o dearly beloved is the genuine christine body and soul and blood and ouns slow music please shut your eyes gents one moment a little trouble about those white corpuscles silence all he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points chrysostomos two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm thanks old chap he cried briskly that will do nicely switch off the current will you he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips the mockery of it he said gaily your absurd name an ancient greek he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself stephen dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck buck mulligan's gay voice went on my name is absurd too malachi mulligan two dactyls but it has a hellenic ring hasn't it tripping and sunny like the buck himself we must go to athens will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid he laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried will he come the jejune jesuit ceasing he began to shave with care tell me mulligan stephen said quietly yes my love how long is haines going to stay in this tower buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder god isn't he dreadful he said frankly a ponderous saxon he thinks you're not a gentleman god these bloody english bursting with money and indigestion because he comes from oxford you know dedalus you have the real oxford manner he can't make you out o my name for you is the best kinch the knife blade he shaved warily over his chin he was raving all night about a black panther stephen said where is his guncase a woful lunatic mulligan said were you in a funk i was stephen said with energy and growing fear out here in the dark with a man i don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther you saved men from drowning i'm not a hero however if he stays on here i am off buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily scutter he cried thickly he came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into stephen's upper pocket said lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly then gazing over the handkerchief he said the bard's noserag a new art colour for our irish poets snotgreen you can almost taste it can't you he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly god he said quietly isn't the sea what algy calls it a great sweet mother the snotgreen sea the scrotumtightening sea epi oinopa ponton ah dedalus the greeks i must teach you you must read them in the original thalatta thalatta she is our great sweet mother come and look stephen stood up and went over to the parapet leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of kingstown our mighty mother buck mulligan said he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephen's face the aunt thinks you killed your mother he said that's why she won't let me have anything to do with you someone killed her stephen said gloomily you could have knelt down damn it kinch when your dying mother asked you buck mulligan said i'm hyperborean as much as you but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her and you refused there is something sinister in you he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek a tolerant smile curled his lips but a lovely mummer he murmured to himself kinch the loveliest mummer of them all he shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously stephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat sleeve pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade ah poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice i must give you a shirt and a few noserags how are the secondhand breeks they fit well enough stephen answered buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip the mockery of it he said contentedly secondleg they should be god knows what poxy bowsy left them off i have a lovely pair with a hair stripe grey you'll look spiffing in them i'm not joking kinch you look damn well when you're dressed thanks stephen said i can't wear them if they are grey he can't wear them buck mulligan told his face in the mirror etiquette is etiquette he kills his mother but he can't wear grey trousers he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes that fellow i was with in the ship last night said buck mulligan says you have g p i he's up in dottyville with connolly norman general paralysis of the insane he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk look at yourself he said you dreadful bard stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleft by a crooked crack hair on end as he and others see me who chose this face for me this dogsbody to rid of vermin it asks me too i pinched it out of the skivvy's room buck mulligan said it does her all right the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi lead him not into temptation and her name is ursula laughing again he brought the mirror away from stephen's peering eyes the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said if wilde were only alive to see you drawing back and pointing stephen said with bitterness it is a symbol of irish art the cracked looking glass of a servant buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephen's and walked with him round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them it's not fair to tease you like that kinch is it he said kindly god knows you have more spirit than any of them parried again he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his the cold steelpen cracked lookingglass of a servant tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea he's stinking with money and thinks you're not a gentleman his old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other god kinch if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island hellenise it cranly's arm his arm and to think of your having to beg from these swine i'm the only one that knows what you are why don't you trust me more what have you up your nose against me is it haines if he makes any noise here i'll bring down seymour and we'll give him a ragging worse than they gave clive kempthorpe young shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpe's rooms palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter one clasping another o i shall expire break the news to her gently aubrey i shall die with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table with trousers down at heels chased by ades of magdalen with the tailor's shears a scared calf's face gilded with marmalade i don't want to be debagged don't you play the giddy ox with me shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle a deaf gardener aproned masked with matthew arnold's face pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms to ourselves new paganism omphalos let him stay stephen said there's nothing wrong with him except at night then what is it buck mulligan asked impatiently cough it up i'm quite frank with you what have you against me now they halted looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale stephen freed his arm quietly do you wish me to tell you he asked yes what is it buck mulligan answered i don't remember anything he looked in stephen's face as he spoke a light wind passed his brow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes stephen depressed by his own voice said do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mother's death buck mulligan frowned quickly and said what where i can't remember anything i remember only ideas and sensations why what happened in the name of god you were making tea stephen said and went across the landing to get more hot water your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom she asked you who was in your room yes buck mulligan said what did i say i forget you said stephen answered o it's only dedalus whose mother is beastly dead a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligan's cheek did i say that he asked well what harm is that he shook his constraint from him nervously and what is death he asked your mother's or yours or my own you saw only your mother die i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom it's a beastly thing and nothing else it simply doesn't matter you wouldn't kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you why because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you only it's injected the wrong way to me it's all a mockery and beastly her cerebral lobes are not functioning she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt humour her till it's over you crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i don't whinge like some hired mute from lalouette's absurd i suppose i did say it i didn't mean to offend the memory of your mother he had spoken himself into boldness stephen shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart said very coldly i am not thinking of the offence to my mother of what then buck mulligan asked of the offence to me stephen answered buck mulligan swung round on his heel o an impossible person he exclaimed he walked off quickly round the parapet stephen stood at his post gazing over the calm sea towards the headland sea and headland now grew dim pulses were beating in his eyes veiling their sight and he felt the fever of his cheeks a voice within the tower called loudly are you up there mulligan i'm coming buck mulligan answered he turned towards stephen and said look at the sea what does it care about offences chuck loyola kinch and come on down the sassenach wants his morning rashers his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase level with the roof don't mope over it all day he said i'm inconsequent give up the moody brooding his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead and no more turn aside and brood upon love's bitter mystery for fergus rules the brazen cars woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened spurned by lightshod hurrying feet white breast of the dim sea the twining stresses two by two a hand plucking the harpstrings merging their twining chords wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide a cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly shadowing the bay in deeper green it lay beneath him a bowl of bitter waters fergus song i sang it alone in the house holding down the long dark chords her door was open she wanted to hear my music silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside she was crying in her wretched bed for those words stephen love's bitter mystery where now her secrets old featherfans tasselled dancecards powdered with musk a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer a birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl she heard old royce sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang i am the boy that can enjoy invisibility phantasmal mirth folded away muskperfumed and no more turn aside and brood folded away in the memory of nature with her toys memories beset his brooding brain her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament a cored apple filled with brown sugar roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children's shirts in a dream silently she had come to him her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath bent over him with mute secret words a faint odour of wetted ashes her glazing eyes staring out of death to shake and bend my soul on me alone the ghostcandle to light her agony ghostly light on the tortured face her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror while all prayed on their knees her eyes on me to strike me down liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat ghoul chewer of corpses no mother let me be and let me live kinch ahoy buck mulligan's voice sang from within the tower it came nearer up the staircase calling again stephen still trembling at his soul's cry heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words dedalus come down like a good mosey breakfast is ready haines is apologising for waking us last night it's all right i'm coming stephen said turning do for jesus sake buck mulligan said for my sake and for all our sakes his head disappeared and reappeared i told him your symbol of irish art he says it's very clever touch him for a quid will you a guinea i mean i get paid this morning stephen said the school kip buck mulligan said how much four quid lend us one if you want it stephen said four shining sovereigns buck mulligan cried with delight we'll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids four omnipotent sovereigns he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs singing out of tune with a cockney accent o won't we have a merry time drinking whisky beer and wine on coronation coronation day o won't we have a merry time on coronation day warm sunshine merrying over the sea the nickel shavingbowl shone forgotten on the parapet why should i bring it down or leave it there all day forgotten friendship he went over to it held it in his hands awhile feeling its coolness smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes i am another now and yet the same a servant too a server of a servant in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligan's gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth hiding and revealing its yellow glow two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated turning we'll be choked buck mulligan said haines open that door will you stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors have you the key a voice asked dedalus has it buck mulligan said janey mack i'm choked he howled without looking up from the fire kinch it's in the lock stephen said coming forward the key scraped round harshly twice and when the heavy door had been set ajar welcome light and bright air entered haines stood at the doorway looking out stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table set them down heavily and sighed with relief i'm melting he said as the candle remarked when but hush not a word more on that subject kinch wake up bread butter honey haines come in the grub is ready bless us o lord and these thy gifts where's the sugar o jay there's no milk stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet what sort of a kip is this he said i told her to come after eight we can drink it black stephen said thirstily there's a lemon in the locker o damn you and your paris fads buck mulligan said i want sandycove milk haines came in from the doorway and said quietly that woman is coming up with the milk the blessings of god on you buck mulligan cried jumping up from his chair sit down pour out the tea there the sugar is in the bag here i can't go fumbling at the damned eggs he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates saying in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti haines sat down to pour out the tea i'm giving you two lumps each he said but i say mulligan you do make strong tea don't you buck mulligan hewing thick slices from the loaf said in an old woman's wheedling voice when i makes tea i makes tea as old mother grogan said and when i makes water i makes water by jove it is tea haines said buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling so i do mrs cahill says she begob ma'am says mrs cahill god send you don't make them in the one pot he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread impaled on his knife that's folk he said very earnestly for your book haines five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of dundrum printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice lifting his brows can you recall brother is mother grogan's tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads i doubt it said stephen gravely do you now buck mulligan said in the same tone your reasons pray i fancy stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion mother grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of mary ann buck mulligan's face smiled with delight charming he said in a finical sweet voice showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly do you think she was quite charming then suddenly overclouding all his features he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf for old mary ann she doesn't care a damn but hising up her petticoats he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned the doorway was darkened by an entering form the milk sir come in ma'am mulligan said kinch get the jug an old woman came forward and stood by stephen's elbow that's a lovely morning sir she said glory be to god to whom mulligan said glancing at her ah to be sure stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker the islanders mulligan said to haines casually speak frequently of the collector of prepuces how much sir asked the old woman a quart stephen said he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk not hers old shrunken paps she poured again a measureful and a tilly old and secret she had entered from a morning world maybe a messenger she praised the goodness of the milk pouring it out crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field a witch on her toadstool her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs they lowed about her whom they knew dewsilky cattle silk of the kine and poor old woman names given her in old times a wandering crone lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer their common cuckquean a messenger from the secret morning to serve or to upbraid whether he could not tell but scorned to beg her favour it is indeed ma'am buck mulligan said pouring milk into their cups taste it sir she said he drank at her bidding if we could live on good food like that he said to her somewhat loudly we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts living in a bogswamp eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust horsedung and consumptives spits are you a medical student sir the old woman asked i am ma'am buck mulligan answered look at that now she said stephen listened in scornful silence she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly her bonesetter her medicineman me she slights to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman's unclean loins of man's flesh made not in god's likeness the serpent's prey and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes do you understand what he says stephen asked her is it french you are talking sir the old woman said to haines haines spoke to her again a longer speech confidently irish buck mulligan said is there gaelic on you i thought it was irish she said by the sound of it are you from the west sir i am an englishman haines answered he's english buck mulligan said and he thinks we ought to speak irish in ireland sure we ought to the old woman said and i'm ashamed i don't speak the language myself i'm told it's a grand language by them that knows grand is no name for it said buck mulligan wonderful entirely fill us out some more tea kinch would you like a cup ma'am no thank you sir the old woman said slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go haines said to her have you your bill we had better pay her mulligan hadn't we stephen filled again the three cups bill sir she said halting well it's seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling that's a shilling and one and two is two and two sir buck mulligan sighed and having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets pay up and look pleasant haines said to him smiling stephen filled a third cup a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk buck mulligan brought up a florin twisted it round in his fingers and cried a miracle he passed it along the table towards the old woman saying ask nothing more of me sweet all i can give you i give stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand we'll owe twopence he said time enough sir she said taking the coin time enough good morning sir she curtseyed and went out followed by buck mulligan's tender chant heart of my heart were it more more would be laid at your feet he turned to stephen and said seriously dedalus i'm stony hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money today the bards must drink and junket ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty that reminds me haines said rising that i have to visit your national library today our swim first buck mulligan said he turned to stephen and asked blandly is this the day for your monthly wash kinch then he said to haines the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month all ireland is washed by the gulfstream stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me speaking to me they wash and tub and scrub agenbite of inwit conscience yet here's a spot that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good buck mulligan kicked stephen's foot under the table and said with warmth of tone wait till you hear him on hamlet haines well i mean it haines said still speaking to stephen i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in would i make any money by it stephen asked haines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock said i don't know i'm sure he strolled out to the doorway buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour you put your hoof in it now what did you say that for well stephen said the problem is to get money from whom from the milkwoman or from him it's a toss up i think i blow him out about you buck mulligan said and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes i see little hope stephen said from her or from him buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephen's arm from me kinch he said in a suddenly changed tone he added to tell you the god's truth i think you're right damn all else they are good for why don't you play them as i do to hell with them all let us get out of the kip he stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown saying resignedly mulligan is stripped of his garments he emptied his pockets on to the table there's your snotrag he said and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief god we'll simply have to dress the character i want puce gloves and green boots contradiction do i contradict myself very well then i contradict myself mercurial malachi a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands and there's your latin quarter hat he said stephen picked it up and put it on haines called to them from the doorway are you coming you fellows i'm ready buck mulligan answered going towards the door come out kinch you have eaten all we left i suppose resigned he passed out with grave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrow and going forth he met butterly stephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it he put the huge key in his inner pocket at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked did you bring the key i have it stephen said preceding them he walked on behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses down sir how dare you sir haines asked do you pay rent for this tower twelve quid buck mulligan said to the secretary of state for war stephen added over his shoulder they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last rather bleak in wintertime i should say martello you call it billy pitt had them built buck mulligan said when the french were on the sea but ours is the omphalos what is your idea of hamlet haines asked stephen no no buck mulligan shouted in pain i'm not equal to thomas aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up wait till i have a few pints in me first he turned to stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat you couldn't manage it under three pints kinch could you it has waited so long stephen said listlessly it can wait longer you pique my curiosity haines said amiably is it some paradox pooh buck mulligan said we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes it's quite simple he proves by algebra that hamlet's grandson is shakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father what haines said beginning to point at stephen he himself buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bending in loose laughter said to stephen's ear o shade of kinch the elder japhet in search of a father we're always tired in the morning stephen said to haines and it is rather long to tell buck mulligan walking forward again raised his hands the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus he said i mean to say haines explained to stephen as they followed this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore that beetles o'er his base into the sea isn't it buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires it's a wonderful tale haines said bringing them to halt again eyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudent the seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the muglins i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemused the father and the son idea the son striving to be atoned with the father buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face he looked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety he moved a doll's head to and fro the brims of his panama hat quivering and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice i'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard my mother's a jew my father's a bird with joseph the joiner i cannot agree so here's to disciples and calvary he held up a forefinger of warning if anyone thinks that i amn't divine he'll get no free drinks when i'm making the wine but have to drink water and wish it were plain that i make when the wine becomes water again he tugged swiftly at stephen's ashplant in farewell and running forward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted goodbye now goodbye write down all i said and tell tom dick and harry i rose from the dead what's bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly and olivet's breezy goodbye now goodbye he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole fluttering his winglike hands leaping nimbly mercury's hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries haines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside stephen and said we oughtn't to laugh i suppose he's rather blasphemous i'm not a believer myself that is to say still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow doesn't it what did he call it joseph the joiner the ballad of joking jesus stephen answered o haines said you have heard it before three times a day after meals stephen said drily you're not a believer are you haines asked i mean a believer in the narrow sense of the word creation from nothing and miracles and a personal god there's only one sense of the word it seems to me stephen said haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it thank you stephen said taking a cigarette haines helped himself and snapped the case to he put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang it open too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towards stephen in the shell of his hands yes of course he said as they went on again either you believe or you don't isn't it personally i couldn't stomach that idea of a personal god you don't stand for that i suppose you behold in me stephen said with grim displeasure a horrible example of free thought he walked on waiting to be spoken to trailing his ashplant by his side its ferrule followed lightly on the path squealing at his heels my familiar after me calling steeeeeeeeeeeephen a wavering line along the path they will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark he wants that key it is mine i paid the rent now i eat his salt bread give him the key too all he will ask for it that was in his eyes after all haines began stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind after all i should think you are able to free yourself you are your own master it seems to me i am a servant of two masters stephen said an english and an italian italian haines said a crazy queen old and jealous kneel down before me and a third stephen said there is who wants me for odd jobs italian haines said again what do you mean the imperial british state stephen answered his colour rising and the holy roman catholic and apostolic church haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke i can quite understand that he said calmly an irishman must think like that i daresay we feel in england that we have treated you rather unfairly it seems history is to blame the proud potent titles clanged over stephen's memory the triumph of their brazen bells et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts a chemistry of stars symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope marcellus the voices blended singing alone loud in affirmation and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs a horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry photius and the brood of mockers of whom mulligan was one and arius warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the son with the father and valentine spurning christ's terrene body and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who held that the father was himself his own son words mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger idle mockery the void awaits surely all them that weave the wind a menace a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church michael's host who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields hear hear prolonged applause zut nom de dieu of course i'm a britisher haines's voice said and i feel as one i don't want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either that's our national problem i'm afraid just now two men stood at the verge of the cliff watching businessman boatman she's making for bullock harbour the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain there's five fathoms out there he said it'll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one it's nine days today the man that was drowned a sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up roll over to the sun a puffy face saltwhite here i am they followed the winding path down to the creek buck mulligan stood on a stone in shirtsleeves his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water is the brother with you malachi down in westmeath with the bannons still there i got a card from bannon says he found a sweet young thing down there photo girl he calls her snapshot eh brief exposure buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots an elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face he scrambled up by the stones water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and glancing at haines and stephen crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone seymour's back in town the young

supermen he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay are you going in here malachi yes make room in the bed the young man shoved himself backward through the water

masonry and time one livid final flame what's left us then i forget the place sir 279 b c asculum stephen said glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book yes sir and he said another victory like that and we are done for that phrase the world had remembered a dull ease of the mind from a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers leaned upon his spear any general to any officers they lend ear you armstrong stephen said what was the end of pyrrhus end of pyrrhus sir i know sir ask me sir comyn said wait you armstrong do you know anything about pyrrhus a bag of figrolls lay snugly in armstrong's satchel he curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips a sweetened boy's breath welloff people proud that their eldest son was in the navy vico road dalkey pyrrhus sir pyrrhus a pier all laughed mirthless high malicious laughter armstrong looked round at his classmates silly glee in profile in a moment they will laugh more loudly aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay tell me now stephen said poking the boy's shoulder with the book what is a pier a pier sir armstrong said a thing out in the water a kind of a bridge kingstown pier sir some laughed again mirthless but with meaning two in the back bench whispered yes they knew had never learned nor ever been innocent all with envy he watched their faces edith ethel gerty lily their likes their breaths too sweetened with tea and jam their bracelets tittering in the struggle kingstown pier stephen said yes a disappointed bridge the words troubled their gaze how sir comyn asked a bridge is across a river for haines's chapbook no one here to hear tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk to pierce the polished mail of his mind what then a jester at the court of his master indulged and disesteemed winning a clement master's praise why had they chosen all that part not wholly for the smooth caress for them too history was a tale like any other too often heard their land a pawnshop had pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam's hand in argos or julius caesar not been knifed to death they are not to be thought away time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted but can those have been possible seeing that they never were or was that only possible which came to pass weave weaver of the wind tell us a story sir o do sir a ghoststory where do you begin in this stephen asked opening another book weep no more comyn said go on then talbot and the story sir after stephen said go on talbot a swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel he recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text weep no more woful shepherds weep no more for lycidas your sorrow is not dead sunk though he be beneath the watery floor it must be a movement then an actuality of the possible as possible aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of saint genevieve where he had read sheltered from the sin of paris night by night by his elbow a delicate siamese conned a handbook of strategy fed and feeding brains about me under glowlamps impaled with faintly beating feelers and in my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld reluctant shy of brightness shifting her dragon scaly folds thought is the thought of thought tranquil brightness the soul is in a manner all that is the soul is the form of forms tranquility sudden vast candescent form of forms talbot repeated through the dear might of him that walked the waves through the dear might turn over stephen said quietly i don't see anything what sir talbot asked simply bending forward his hand turned the page over he leaned back and went on again having just remembered of him that walked the waves here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer's heart and lips and on mine it lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute to caesar what is caesar's to god what is god's a long look from dark eyes a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church's looms ay riddle me riddle me randy ro my father gave me seeds to sow talbot slid his closed book into his satchel have i heard all stephen asked yes sir hockey at ten sir half day sir thursday who can answer a riddle stephen asked they bundled their books away pencils clacking pages rustling crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels all gabbling gaily a riddle sir ask me sir o ask me sir a hard one sir this is the riddle stephen said the cock crew the sky was blue the bells in heaven were striking eleven tis time for this poor soul to go to heaven what is that what sir again sir we didn't hear their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated after a silence cochrane said what is it sir we give it up stephen his throat itching answered the fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush he stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay a stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called hockey they broke asunder sidling out of their benches leaping them quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly showing an open copybook his thick hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading on his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshaped recent and damp as a snail's bed he held out his copybook the word sums was written on the headline beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot cyril sargent his name and seal mr deasy told me to write them out all again he said and show them to you sir stephen touched the edges of the book futility do you understand how to do them now he asked numbers eleven to fifteen sargent answered mr deasy said i was to copy them off the board sir can you do them yourself stephen asked no sir ugly and futile lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink a snail's bed yet someone had loved him borne him in her arms and in her heart but for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot a squashed boneless snail she had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own was that then real the only true thing in life his mother's prostrate body the fiery columbanus in holy zeal bestrode she was no more the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes she had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone scarcely having been a poor soul gone to heaven and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox red reek of rapine in his fur with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth listened scraped up the earth listened scraped and scraped sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem he proves by algebra that shakespeare's ghost is hamlet's grandfather sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice in the mummery of their letters wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes give hands traverse bow to partner so imps of fancy of the moors gone too from the world averroes and moses maimonides dark men in mien and movement flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend do you understand now can you work the second for yourself yes sir in long shaky strokes sargent copied the data waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin amor matris subjective and objective genitive with her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands like him was i these sloping shoulders this gracelessness my childhood bends beside me too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly mine is far and his secret as our eyes secrets silent stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of their tyranny tyrants willing to be dethroned the sum was done it is very simple stephen said as he stood up yes sir thanks sargent answered he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench you had better get your stick and go out to the others stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy's graceless form yes sir in the corridor his name was heard called from the playfield sargent run on stephen said mr deasy is calling you he stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife they were sorted in teams and mr deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet when he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him he turned his angry white moustache what is it now he cried continually without listening cochrane and halliday are on the same side sir stephen said will you wait in my study for a moment mr deasy said till i restore order here and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man's voice cried sternly what is the matter what is it now their sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many forms closed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs as on the first day he bargained with me here as it was in the beginning is now on the sideboard the tray of stuart coins base treasure of a bog and ever shall be and snug in their spooncase of purple plush faded the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles world without end a hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor blowing out his rare moustache mr deasy halted at the table first our little financial settlement he said he brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong it slapped open and he took from it two notes one of joined halves and laid them carefully on the table two he said strapping and stowing his pocketbook away and now his strongroom for the gold stephen's embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar whelks and money cowries and leopard shells and this whorled as an emir's turban and this the scallop of saint james an old pilgrim's hoard dead treasure hollow shells a sovereign fell bright and new on the soft pile of the tablecloth three mr deasy said turning his little savingsbox about in his hand these are handy things to have see this is for sovereigns this is for shillings sixpences halfcrowns and here crowns see he shot from it two crowns and two shillings three twelve he said i think you'll find that's right thank you sir stephen said gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers no thanks at all mr deasy said you have earned it stephen's hand free again went back to the hollow shells symbols too of beauty and of power a lump in my pocket symbols soiled by greed and misery don't carry it like that mr deasy said you'll pull it out somewhere and lose it you just buy one of these machines you'll find them very handy answer something mine would be often empty stephen said the same room and hour the same wisdom and i the same three times now three nooses round me here well i can break them in this instant if i will because you don't save mr deasy said pointing his finger you don't know yet what money is money is power when you have lived as long as i have i know i know if youth but knew but what does shakespeare say put but money in thy purse iago stephen murmured he lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man's stare he knew what money was mr deasy said he made money a poet yes but an englishman too do you know what is the pride of the english do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an englishman's mouth the seas ruler his seacold eyes looked on the empty bay it seems history is to blame on me and on my words unhating that on his empire stephen said the sun never sets ba mr deasy cried that's not english a french celt said that he tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail i will tell you he said solemnly what is his proudest boast i paid my way good man good man i paid my way i never borrowed a shilling in my life can you feel that i owe nothing can you mulligan nine pounds three pairs of socks one pair brogues ties curran ten guineas mccann one guinea fred ryan two shillings temple two lunches russell one guinea cousins ten shillings bob reynolds half a guinea koehler three guineas mrs mackernan five weeks board the lump i have is useless for the moment no stephen answered mr deasy laughed with rich delight putting back his savingsbox i knew you couldn't he said joyously but one day you must feel it we are a generous people but we must also be just i fear those big words stephen said which make us so unhappy mr deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan filibegs albert edward prince of wales you think me an old fogey and an old tory his thoughtful voice said i saw three generations since o'connell's time i remember the famine in 46 do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before o'connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue you fenians forget some things glorious pious and immortal memory the lodge of diamond in armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes hoarse masked and armed the planters covenant the black north and true blue bible croppies lie down stephen sketched a brief gesture i have rebel blood in me too mr deasy said on the spindle side but i am descended from sir john blackwood who voted for the union we are all irish all kings sons alas stephen said per vias rectas mr deasy said firmly was his motto he voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to dublin from the ards of down to do so lal the ral the ra the rocky road to dublin a gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots soft day sir john soft day your honour day day two topboots jog dangling on to dublin lal the ral the ra lal the ral the raddy that reminds me mr deasy said you can do me a favour mr dedalus with some of your literary friends i have a letter here for the press sit down a moment i have just to copy the end he went to the desk near the window pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter sit down excuse me he said over his shoulder the dictates of common sense just a moment he peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and muttering began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage their meek heads poised in air lord hastings repulse the duke of westminster's shotover the duke of beaufort's ceylon prix de paris 1866 elfin riders sat them watchful of a sign he saw their speeds backing king's colours and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds full stop mr deasy bade his keys but prompt ventilation of this allimportant question where cranly led me to get rich quick hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen over the motley slush fair rebel fair rebel even money the favourite ten to one the field dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman a butcher's dame nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange shouts rang shrill from the boys playfield and a whirring whistle again a goal i am among them among their battling bodies in a medley the joust of life you mean that knockkneed mother's darling who seems to be slightly crawsick jousts time shocked rebounds shock by shock jousts slush and uproar of battles the frozen deathspew of the slain a shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts now then mr deasy said rising he came to the table pinning together his sheets stephen stood up i have put the matter into a nutshell mr deasy said it's about the foot and mouth disease just look through it there can be no two opinions on the matter may i trespass on your valuable space that doctrine of laissez faire which so often in our history our cattle trade the way of all our old industries liverpool ring which jockeyed the galway harbour scheme european conflagration grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel the pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of agriculture pardoned a classical allusion cassandra by a woman who was no better than she should be to come to the point at issue i don't mince words do i mr deasy asked as stephen read on foot and mouth disease known as koch's preparation serum and virus percentage of salted horses rinderpest emperor's horses at murzsteg lower austria veterinary surgeons mr henry blackwood price courteous offer a fair trial dictates of common sense allimportant question in every sense of the word take the bull by the horns thanking you for the hospitality of your columns i want that to be printed and read mr

austria by cattledoctors there they offer to come over here i am trying to work up influence with the department now i'm going to try publicity i am surrounded by difficulties by intrigues by backstairs influence by he raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke mark my words mr dedalus he said england is in the hands of the jews in all the highest places her finance her press and they are the signs of a nation's decay wherever they gather they eat up the nation's vital strength i have seen it coming these years as sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction old england is dying he stepped swiftly off his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam he faced about and back again dying he said again if not dead by now the harlot's cry from street to street shall weave old england's windingsheet his eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted a merchant stephen said is one who buys cheap and sells dear jew or gentile is he not they sinned against the light mr deasy said gravely and you can see the darkness in their eyes and that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers gabble of geese they swarmed loud uncouth about the temple their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats not theirs these clothes this speech these gestures their full slow eyes belied the words the gestures eager and unoffending but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain vain patience to heap and hoard time surely would scatter all a hoard heaped by the roadside plundered and passing on their eyes knew their years of wandering and patient knew the dishonours of their flesh who has not stephen said what do you mean mr deasy asked he came forward a pace and stood by the table his underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly is this old wisdom he waits to hear from me history stephen said is a nightmare from which i am trying to awake from the playfield the boys raised a shout a whirring whistle goal what if that nightmare gave you a back kick the ways of the creator are not our ways mr deasy said all human history moves towards one great goal the manifestation of god stephen jerked his thumb towards the window saying that is god hooray ay whrrwhee what mr deasy asked a shout in the street stephen answered shrugging his shoulders mr deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers looking up again he set them free i am happier than you are he said we have committed many errors and many sins a woman brought sin into the world for a woman who was no better than she should be helen the runaway wife of menelaus ten years the greeks made war on troy a faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here macmurrough's wife and her leman o'rourke prince of breffni a woman too brought parnell low many errors many failures but not the one sin i am a struggler now at the end of my days but i will fight for the right till the end for ulster will fight and ulster will be right stephen raised the sheets in his hand well sir he began i foresee mr deasy said that you will not remain here very long at this work you were not born to be a teacher i think perhaps i am wrong a learner rather stephen said and here what will you learn more mr deasy shook his head who knows he said to learn one must be humble but life is the great teacher stephen rustled the sheets again as regards these he began yes mr deasy said you have two copies there if you can have them published at once telegraph irish homestead i will try stephen said and let you know tomorrow i know two editors slightly that will do mr deasy said briskly i wrote last night to mr field m p there is a meeting of the cattletraders association today at the city arms hotel i asked him to lay my letter before the meeting you see if you can get it into your two papers what are they the evening telegraph that will do mr deasy said there is no time to lose now i have to answer that letter from my cousin good morning sir stephen said putting the sheets in his pocket thank you not at all mr deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk i like to break a lance with you old as i am good morning sir stephen said again bowing to his bent back he went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield the lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate toothless terrors still i will help him in his fight mulligan will dub me a new name the bullockbefriending bard mr dedalus running after me no more letters i hope just one moment yes sir stephen said turning back at the gate mr deasy halted breathing hard and swallowing his breath i just wanted to say he said ireland they say has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews do you know that no and do you know why he frowned sternly on the bright air why sir stephen asked beginning to smile because she never let them in mr deasy said solemnly a coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm he turned back quickly coughing laughing his lifted arms waving to the air she never let them in he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path that's why on his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun

bed as he went down the kitchen stairs she called poldy what scald the teapot on the boil sure enough a plume of steam from the spout he scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in having set it to draw he took off the kettle crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt while he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him give her too much meat she won't mouse say they won't eat pork kosher here he let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid

carried it upstairs his thumb hooked in the teapot handle nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead what a time you were she said she set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly an elbow on the pillow he looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat's udder the warmth of her couched body rose on the air mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured a strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow in the act of going he stayed to straighten the

you leave anything on the fire the kidney he cried suddenly he fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and stubbing his toes against the broken commode hurried out towards the smell stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork's legs pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan by prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back only a little burnt he tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it cup of tea now he sat down cut and buttered a slice of the loaf he shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat then he put a forkful into his mouth chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat done to a turn a mouthful of tea then he cut away dies of bread sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth what was that about some young student and a picnic he creased out the letter at his side reading it slowly as he chewed sopping another die of bread in the gravy

easy no great hurry keep it a bit our prize titbit matcham's masterstroke written by mr philip beaufoy playgoers club london payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer three and a half three pounds three three pounds thirteen and six quietly he read restraining himself the first column and yielding but resisting began the second midway his last resistance yielding he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone hope it's not too big bring on piles again no just right so ah costive one tabloid of cascara sagrada life might be so it did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat print anything now silly season he read on seated calm above his own rising smell neat certainly matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now begins and ends morally hand in hand smart he glanced back through what he had read and while feeling his water flow quietly he envied kindly mr beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds thirteen and six might manage a sketch by mr and mrs l m bloom invent a story for

eyes it wouldn't pan out somehow evening hours girls in grey gauze night hours then black with daggers and eyemasks poetical idea pink then golden then grey then black still true to life also day then the night he tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it then he girded up his trousers braced and buttoned himself he pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air in the bright light lightened and cooled in limb he eyed carefully his black trousers the ends the knees the houghs of the knees what time is the funeral better find out in the paper a creak and a dark whirr in the air high up the bells of george's church they tolled the hour loud dark iron heigho heigho heigho heigho heigho heigho quarter to there again the overtone following through the air third poor dignam by lorries along sir john rogerson's quay mr bloom walked soberly past windmill lane leask's the linseed crusher the postal telegraph office could have given that address too and past the sailors home he turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through lime street by brady's cottages a boy for the skins lolled his bucket of offal linked smoking a chewed fagbutt a smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him listlessly holding her battered caskhoop tell him if he smokes he won't grow o let him his life isn't such

the window of the belfast and oriental tea company and read the legends of leadpapered packets choice blend finest quality family tea rather warm tea must get some from tom kernan couldn't ask him at a funeral though while his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair very warm morning under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha just there his right hand came down into the bowl of his hat his fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket so warm his right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair then he put on his hat again relieved and read again choice blend made of the finest ceylon brands the far east lovely spot it must be the garden of the world big lazy leaves to float about on cactuses flowery meads snaky lianas they call them wonder is it like that those cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente not doing a hand's turn all day sleep six months out of twelve too hot to quarrel influence of the climate lethargy flowers of idleness the air feeds most azotes hothouse in botanic gardens sensitive plants waterlilies petals too tired to sleeping sickness in the air walk on roseleaves imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel where was the chap i saw in that picture somewhere ah yes in the dead sea floating on his back reading a book with a parasol open couldn't sink if you tried so thick with salt because the weight of the water no the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what or is it the volume is equal to the weight it's a law something like that vance in high school cracking his fingerjoints teaching the college curriculum cracking curriculum what is weight really when you say the weight thirtytwo feet per second per second law of falling bodies per second per second they all fall to the ground the earth it's the force of gravity of the earth is the weight he turned away and sauntered across the road how did she walk with her sausages like that something as he walked he took the folded freeman from his sidepocket unfolded it rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg careless air just drop in to see per second per second per second for every second it means from the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice too late box post here no one in he handed the card through the brass grill are there any letters for me he asked while the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils smelling freshprinted rag paper no answer probably went too far last time the postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter he thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope henry flower esq c/o p o westland row city answered anyhow he slipped card and letter into his sidepocket reviewing again the soldiers on parade where's old tweedy's regiment castoff soldier there bearskin cap and hackle plume no he's a grenadier pointed cuffs there he is royal dublin fusiliers redcoats too showy that must be why the women go after them uniform easier to enlist and drill maud gonne's letter about taking them off o'connell street at night disgrace to our irish capital griffith's paper is on the same tack now an army rotten with venereal disease overseas or halfseasover empire half baked they look hypnotised like eyes front mark time table able bed ed the king's own never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby a mason yes he strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right talk as if that would mend matters his hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope ripping it open in jerks women will pay a lot of heed i don't think his fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket something pinned on photo perhaps hair no m'coy get rid of him quickly take me out of my way hate company when you hello bloom

grosvenor the porter hoisted the valise up on the well she stood still waiting while the man husband brother like her searched his pockets for change stylish kind of coat with that roll collar warm for a day like this looks like blanketcloth careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets like that haughty creature at the polo match women all for caste till you touch the spot handsome is and handsome does reserved about to yield the honourable mrs and brutus is an honourable man possess her once take the starch out of her i was with bob doran he's on one of his periodical bends and what do you call him bantam lyons just down there in conway's we were doran lyons in conway's she raised a gloved hand to her hair in came hoppy having a wet drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare the braided drums clearly i can see today moisture about gives long sight perhaps talking of one thing or another lady's hand which side will she get up and he said sad thing about our poor friend paddy what paddy i said poor little paddy dignam he said off to the country broadstone probably high brown boots with

friendliness my wife too he said she's going to sing at a swagger affair in the ulster hall belfast on the twenty fifth that so m'coy said glad to hear that old man who's getting it up mrs marion bloom not up yet queen was in her bedroom eating bread and no book blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens dark lady and fair man letter cat furry black ball torn strip of envelope love's

suppose she wouldn't let herself be vaccinated again your wife and my wife wonder is he pimping after me mr bloom stood at the corner his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings cantrell and cochrane's ginger ale aromatic clery's summer sale no he's going on straight hello leah tonight mrs bandmann palmer like to see her again in that hamlet she played last night male impersonator perhaps he was a woman why ophelia committed suicide poor papa how he used to talk of kate bateman in that outside the adelphi in london waited all the afternoon to get in year before i was born that was sixtyfive and ristori in vienna what is this the right name is by mosenthal it is rachel is it no the scene he was always talking about where the old blind abraham recognises the voice and puts his

every word is so deep leopold poor papa poor man i'm glad i didn't go into the room to look at his face that day o dear o dear ffoo well perhaps it was best for him mr bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard no use thinking of it any more nosebag time wish i hadn't met that m'coy fellow he came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats the gently champing teeth their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss their eldorado poor jugginses damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags too full for words still they get their feed all right and their doss gelded too a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches might be happy all the same that way good poor brutes they look still their neigh can be very irritating he drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried might just walk into her here the lane is safer he passed the cabman's shelter curious the life of drifting cabbies all weathers all places time or setdown no will of their own voglio e non like to give them an odd cigarette sociable shout a few flying syllables as they pass he hummed la ci darem la mano la la lala la la he turned into cumberland street and going on some paces halted in the lee of the station wall no one meade's timberyard piled balks ruins and tenements with careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone not a sinner near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles alone shooting the taw with a cunnythumb a wise tabby a blinking sphinx watched from her warm sill pity to disturb them mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her open it and once i played marbles when i went to that old dame's

pocket language of flowers they like it because no one can hear or a poison bouquet to strike him down then walking slowly forward he read the letter again murmuring here and there a word angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don't please poor forgetmenot how i long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife martha's perfume having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket weak joy opened his lips changed since the first letter wonder did she wrote it herself doing the indignant a girl of good family like me respectable character could meet one sunday after the rosary thank you not having any usual love scrimmage then running round corners bad as a row with molly cigar has a cooling effect narcotic go further next time naughty boy punish afraid of words of course brutal why not try it anyhow a bit at a time fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it common pin eh he threw it on the road out of her clothes somewhere pinned together queer the number of pins they always have no roses without thorns flat dublin voices bawled in his head those two sluts that night in the coombe linked together in the rain o mary lost the pin of her drawers she didn't know what to do to keep it up to keep it up it them such a bad headache has her roses probably or sitting all

in the wall at ashtown must carry a paper goblet next time i go to the trottingmatches she listens with big dark soft eyes tell her more and more all then a sigh silence long long long rest going under the railway arch he took out the envelope tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road the shreds fluttered away sank in the dank air a white flutter then all sank henry flower

flood leaked out flowing together winding through mudflats all over the level land a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth he had reached the open backdoor of all hallows stepping into the porch he doffed his hat took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband damn it i might have tried to work m'coy for a pass to mullingar same

crustcrumbs from under his thighs what is this he said in the name of god crumbs someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately mr power said all raised their thighs and eyed with

the stumping figure and said mildly the devil break the hasp of your back mr power collapsing in laughter shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed gray's statue we have all been there

into the liffey for god's sake mr dedalus exclaimed in fright is he dead dead martin cunningham cried not he a boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive half the town was there yes mr bloom said but the funny part is and reuben j martin cunningham said gave the boatman a florin for saving his son's life a stifled sigh came from under mr power's hand o he did martin cunningham affirmed like a hero a silver florin isn't it awfully good mr bloom said eagerly one and eightpence too much mr dedalus said

carriage climbed more slowly the hill of rutland square rattle his bones over the stones only a pauper nobody owns in the midst of life martin cunningham said but the worst of all mr power said is the man who takes his own life martin cunningham drew out his watch briskly coughed and put it back the greatest disgrace to have in the family mr power added temporary insanity of course martin cunningham said decisively we must take a charitable view of it they say a man who does it is a coward mr dedalus said it is not for us to judge martin cunningham said mr bloom about to speak closed his lips again martin cunningham's large eyes looking away now sympathetic human man he is intelligent like shakespeare's face always a good word to say they have no mercy on that here or infanticide

lying in hospital they told me from one extreme to the other the carriage galloped round a corner stopped what's wrong now a divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows lowing slouching by on padded hoofs whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear emigrants mr power said huuuh the drover's voice cried his

margarine wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at clonsilla the carriage moved on through the drove i can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays mr bloom said all those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats instead of blocking up the thoroughfare martin cunningham said quite right they ought to yes mr bloom said and another thing i often thought is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in milan you know run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams hearse and carriage and all don't you see what i mean o that be damned for a story mr dedalus said pullman car and saloon diningroom a poor lookout for corny mr power added why mr bloom asked turning to mr dedalus wouldn't it be more decent than galloping two abreast well there's something in that mr dedalus granted and martin cunningham said we wouldn't have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round dunphy's and upset

the friends of the stiff corny kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths who is that beside them ah the brother in law all walked after martin cunningham whispered i was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before bloom what mr power whispered how so his father poisoned himself martin cunningham whispered had the queen's hotel in ennis you heard him say he was going to clare anniversary o god mr power whispered first i heard of it poisoned himself he glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal's mausoleum speaking was he insured mr bloom asked i believe so mr kernan answered but the policy was heavily mortgaged martin is trying to get the youngster into artane how many children did he leave five ned lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into todd's a sad case mr bloom said gently five young children a great blow to the poor wife mr kernan added indeed yes mr bloom agreed has the laugh at him now he looked

that job john henry is not the worst in the world how did he lose it ned lambert asked liquor what many a good man's fault mr dedalus said with a sigh they halted about the door of the mortuary chapel mr bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar poor boy was he there when the father both unconscious lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time all he might have done i owe three shillings to o'grady would he understand the mutes bore the coffin into the chapel which end is his head after a moment he followed the others in blinking in the screened light the coffin lay on its bier before the chancel four tall yellow candles at its corners always in front of us corny kelleher laying a wreath at each fore corner beckoned to the boy to kneel the mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks mr bloom stood behind near the font and when all had knelt dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it he fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and holding its brim bent over piously a server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door the whitesmocked priest came after him tidying his stole with one hand balancing with the other a little book against his toad's belly who'll read the book i said the rook they halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak father coffey i knew his name was like a coffin domine namine bully about the muzzle he looks bosses the show muscular christian woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him priest thou art peter burst sideways like a sheep in clover dedalus says he will with a belly on him like a poisoned pup

rushes blue one whiff of that and you're a goner my kneecap is hurting me ow that's better the priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's bucket and shook it over the coffin then he walked to the other end and shook it again then he came back and put it back in the bucket as you were before you rested it's all written down he has to do it et ne nos inducas in tentationem the server piped the answers in the treble i often thought it would be better to have boy servants up to fifteen or so after that of course holy water that was i expect shaking sleep out of it he must be fed up with that job shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up what harm if he could see what he was shaking it over every mortal day a fresh batch middleaged men old women children women dead in childbirth men with beards baldheaded businessmen consumptive girls with little sparrows breasts all the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them sleep on dignam now in paradisum said he was going to paradise or is in paradise says that over everybody tiresome kind of a job but he has to say something the priest closed his book and went off followed by the server corny kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in hoisted the coffin again carried it out and shoved it on their cart corny kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother in law all followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air mr bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket he gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left the metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres the ree the ra the ree the ra the roo lord i mustn't lilt here the o'connell circle mr dedalus said about him mr power's soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone he's at rest he said in the middle of his people old dan o but his heart is buried in rome how many broken hearts are buried here simon her grave is over there jack mr dedalus said i'll soon be stretched beside her let him take me whenever he likes breaking down he began to weep to himself quietly stumbling a little in his walk mr power took his arm she's better where she is he said kindly i suppose so mr dedalus said with a weak gasp i suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven corny kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by sad occasions mr kernan began politely mr bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head the others are putting on their hats mr kernan said i suppose we can do so too we are the last this cemetery is a treacherous place they covered their heads the reverend gentleman read the service too quickly don't you think mr kernan said with reproof mr bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes secret eyes secretsearching mason i think not sure beside him again we are the last in the same boat hope he'll say something else mr kernan added the service of the irish church used in mount jerome is simpler more impressive i must say mr bloom gave prudent assent the language of course was another thing mr kernan said with solemnity i am the resurrection and the life that touches a man's inmost heart it does mr bloom said your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies no touching that seat of the affections broken heart a pump after all pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day one fine day it gets bunged up and there you are lots of them lying around here lungs hearts livers old rusty pumps damn the thing else the resurrection and the life once you are dead you are dead that last day idea

find damn all of himself that morning pennyweight of powder in a skull twelve grammes one pennyweight troy measure corny kelleher fell into step at their side everything went off a1 he said what he looked on them from his drawling eye policeman's shoulders with your tooraloom tooraloom as it should be mr kernan said what eh corny kelleher said mr kernan assured him who is that chap behind with tom kernan john henry menton asked i know his face ned lambert glanced back bloom he said madame marion tweedy that was is i mean the soprano she's his wife o to be sure john henry menton said i haven't seen her for some time he was a finelooking woman i danced with her wait fifteen seventeen golden years ago at mat dillon's in roundtown and a good armful she was he looked behind through the others what is he he asked what does he do wasn't he in the stationery line i fell foul of him one evening i remember at bowls ned lambert smiled yes he was he said in wisdom hely's a traveller for blottingpaper in god's name john henry menton said what did she marry a coon like that for she had plenty of game in her then has still ned lambert said he does some canvassing for ads john henry menton's large eyes stared ahead the barrow turned into a side lane a portly man ambushed among the grasses raised his hat in homage the gravediggers touched their caps john o'connell mr power said pleased he never forgets a friend mr o'connell shook all their hands in silence mr dedalus said i am come to pay you another visit my dear simon the caretaker answered in a low voice i don't want your custom at all saluting ned lambert and john henry menton he walked on at martin cunningham's side puzzling two long keys at his back did you hear that one he asked them about mulcahy from the coombe i did not martin cunningham said they bent their silk hats in concert and hynes inclined his ear the caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles they tell the story he said that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs they asked for mulcahy from the coombe and were told where he was buried after traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough one of the drunks spelt out the name terence mulcahy the other drunk was blinking up at a statue of our saviour the widow had got put up the caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed he resumed and after blinking up at the sacred figure not a bloody bit like the man says he that's not mulcahy says he whoever done it rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher accepting the dockets given him turning them over and scanning them as he walked that's all done with a purpose martin cunningham explained to hynes i know hynes said i know that to cheer a fellow up martin cunningham said it's pure goodheartedness damn the thing else mr bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk all want to be on good terms with him decent fellow john o'connell real good sort keys like keyes's ad no fear of anyone getting out no passout checks habeas corpus i must see about that ad after the funeral did i write ballsbridge on the envelope i took to cover when she disturbed me writing to martha hope it's not chucked in the dead letter office be the better of a shave grey sprouting beard that's the

couldn't standing his head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing all honeycombed the ground must be oblong cells and very neat he keeps it too trim grass and edgings

breed a devil of a lot of maggots soil must be simply swirling with them your head it simply swurls those pretty little seaside gurls he looks cheerful enough over it gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first wonder how he looks at life cracking his jokes too warms the cockles of his heart the one about the bulletin spurgeon went to heaven 4 a m this morning 11 p m closing time not arrived yet peter the dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's in fashion a juicy pear or ladies punch hot strong and sweet keep out the damp you must laugh sometimes so better do it that way gravediggers in hamlet shows the profound knowledge of the human heart daren't joke about the dead for two years at least de mortuis nil nisi prius go out of mourning first hard to imagine his funeral seems a sort of a joke read your own obituary notice they say you live longer gives you second wind new lease of life how many have you for tomorrow the caretaker asked two corny kelleher said half ten and eleven the caretaker put the papers in his pocket the barrow had ceased to trundle the mourners split and moved to each side of the hole stepping with care round the graves the gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink looping the bands round it burying him we come to bury caesar his ides of march or june he doesn't know who is here nor care now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh now who is he i'd like to know now i'd give a trifle to know who he is always someone turns up you never dreamt of a fellow could live on his lonesome all his life yes he could still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave we all do only man buries no ants too first thing strikes anybody bury the dead say robinson crusoe was true to life well then friday buried him every friday buries a thursday if you come to look at it o poor robinson crusoe how could you possibly do so poor dignam his last lie on the earth in his box when you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood all gnawed through they could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding let it down that way ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow's they're so particular lay me in my native earth bit of clay from the holy land only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin i see what it means i see to protect him as long as possible even in the earth the irishman's house is his coffin embalming in catacombs mummies the same idea mr bloom stood far back his hat in his hand counting the bared heads twelve i'm thirteen no the chap in the macintosh is thirteen death's number where the deuce did he pop out of he wasn't in the chapel that i'll swear silly superstition that about thirteen nice soft tweed ned lambert has in that suit tinge of purple i had one like that when we lived in lombard street west dressy fellow he was once used to change three suits in the day must get that grey suit of mine turned by mesias hello it's dyed his wife i forgot he's not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him the coffin dived out of sight eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles they struggled up and out and all uncovered twenty pause if we were all suddenly somebody else far away a donkey brayed rain no such ass never see a dead one they say shame of death they hide also poor papa went away gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper whisper the boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space mr bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker wellcut frockcoat weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next well it is a long rest feel no more it's the moment you feel must be damned unpleasant can't believe it at first mistake must be someone else try the house opposite wait i wanted to i haven't yet then darkened deathchamber light they want whispering around you would you like to see a priest then rambling and wandering delirium all you hid all your life the death struggle his sleep is not natural press his lower eyelid watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he's doomed devil in that picture of sinner's death showing him a woman dying to embrace her in his shirt last act of lucia shall i nevermore behold thee bam he expires gone at last people talk about you a bit forget you don't forget to pray for him remember him in your prayers even parnell ivy day dying out then they follow dropping into a hole one after the other we are praying now for the repose of his soul hoping you're well and not in hell nice change of air out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself they say you do when you shiver in the sun someone walking over it callboy's warning near you mine over there towards finglas the plot i bought mamma poor mamma and little rudy the gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin mr bloom turned away his face and if he was alive all the time whew by jingo that would be awful no no he is dead of course of course he is dead monday he died they ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole flag of distress three days rather long to keep them in summer just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there's no the clay fell softer begin to be forgotten out of sight out of mind the caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat had enough of it the mourners took heart of grace one by one covering themselves without show mr bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves quietly sure of his ground he traversed the dismal fields hynes jotting down something in his notebook ah the names but he knows them all no coming to me i am just taking the names hynes said below his breath what is your christian name i'm not sure l mr bloom said leopold and you might put down m'coy's name too he asked me to charley hynes said writing i know he was on the freeman once so he was before he got the job in the morgue under louis byrne good idea a postmortem for doctors find out what they imagine they know he died of a tuesday got the run levanted with the cash of a few ads charley you're my darling that was why he asked me to o well does no harm i saw to that m'coy thanks old chap much obliged leave him under an obligation costs nothing and tell us hynes said do you know that fellow in the fellow was over there in the he looked around macintosh yes i saw him mr bloom said where is he now m'intosh hynes said scribbling i don't know who he is is that his name he moved away looking about him no mr bloom began turning and stopping i say hynes didn't hear what where has he disappeared to not a sign well of all the has anybody here seen kay ee double ell become invisible good lord what became of him a seventh gravedigger came beside mr bloom to take up an idle spade o excuse me he stepped aside nimbly clay brown damp began to be seen in the hole it rose nearly over a mound of damp clods rose more rose and the gravediggers rested their spades all uncovered again for a few instants the boy propped his wreath against a corner the brother in law his on a lump the gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow then knocked the blades lightly on the turf clean one bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass one leaving his mates walked slowly on with shouldered weapon its blade blueglancing silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband his navelcord the brother in law turning away placed something in his free hand thanks in silence sorry sir trouble headshake i know that for yourselves just the mourners moved away slowly without aim by devious paths staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb let us go round by the chief's grave hynes said we have time let us mr power said they turned to the right following their slow thoughts with awe mr power's blank voice spoke some say he is not in that grave at all that the coffin was filled with stones that one day he will come again hynes shook his head parnell will never come again he said he's there all that was mortal of him peace to his ashes mr bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels crosses broken pillars family vaults stone hopes praying with upcast eyes old ireland's hearts and hands more sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living pray for the repose of the soul of does anybody really plant him and have done with him like down a coalshoot then lump them together to save time all souls day twentyseventh i'll be at his grave ten shillings for the gardener he keeps it free of weeds old man himself bent down double with his shears clipping near death's door who passed away who departed this life as if they did it of their own accord got the shove all of them who kicked the bucket more interesting if they told you what they were so and so wheelwright i travelled for cork lino i paid five shillings in the pound or a woman's with her saucepan i cooked good irish stew eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it wordsworth or thomas campbell entered into rest the protestants put it old dr murren's the great physician called him home well it's god's acre for them nice country residence newly plastered and painted ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the church times marriage ads they never try to beautify rusty wreaths hung on knobs garlands of bronzefoil better value that for the money still the flowers are more poetical the other gets rather tiresome never withering expresses nothing immortelles a bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch like stuffed like the wedding present alderman hooper gave us hoo not a budge out of him knows there are no catapults to let fly at him dead animal even sadder silly milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave the sacred heart that is showing it heart on his sleeve ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that seems anything but pleased why this infliction would birds come then and peck like the boy

professor machugh murmured softly biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane mr dedalus staring from the empty fireplace at ned lambert's quizzing face asked of it sourly agonising christ wouldn't it give you a heartburn on your arse ned lambert seated on the table read on or again note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way tho quarrelling with the stony obstacles to the tumbling waters of neptune's blue domain mid mossy banks fanned by gentlest zephyrs played on by the glorious sunlight or neath the shadows cast o'er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest what about that simon he asked over the fringe of his newspaper how's that for high changing his drink mr dedalus said ned lambert laughing struck the newspaper on his knees repeating the pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage o boys o boys and xenophon looked upon marathon mr dedalus said looking again on the fireplace and to the window and marathon looked on the sea that will do professor machugh cried from the window i don't want to hear any more of the stuff he ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and hungered made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand high falutin stuff bladderbags ned lambert is taking a day off i see rather upsets a man's day a funeral does he has influence they say old chatterton the vicechancellor is

be seen and heard he's in his sanctum with lenehan j j o'molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file practice dwindling a mighthavebeen losing heart gambling debts of honour reaping the whirlwind used to get good retainers from d and t fitzgerald their wigs to show the grey matter brains on their sleeve like the statue in glasnevin believe he does some

moment ah listen to this for god sake ned lambert pleaded or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks bombast the professor broke in testily enough of the inflated windbag peaks ned lambert went on towering high on high to bathe our souls as it were bathe his lips mr dedalus said blessed and eternal god yes is he taking anything for it as twere in the peerless panorama of ireland's portfolio unmatched despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions for very beauty of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious irish twilight his native doric the moon professor machugh said he forgot hamlet that mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence o mr dedalus cried giving vent to a hopeless groan shite and onions that'll do ned life is too short he took off his silk hat and blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache welshcombed his hair with raking fingers ned lambert tossed the newspaper aside chuckling with delight an instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor machugh's unshaven blackspectacled face doughy daw he cried what wetherup said all very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff he was in the bakery line too wasn't he why they call him doughy daw feathered his nest well anyhow daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor hooked that nicely entertainments open house big blowout wetherup always said that get a grip of them by the stomach the inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face crested by a comb of feathery hair thrust itself in the bold blue eyes stared

dedalus said putting on his hat i must get a drink after that drink the editor cried no drinks served before mass quite right too mr dedalus said going out come on ned ned lambert sidled down from the

agreed passing out he whispered to j j o'molloy incipient jigs sad case ohio the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face my ohio a perfect cretic the professor said long short and long o harp eolian he took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and breaking off a piece twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth bingbang bangbang mr bloom seeing the coast clear made for the inner door just a moment mr crawford he said i just want to phone about an ad he went in what about that leader this evening professor machugh asked coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder that'll be all right myles crawford said more calmly never you fret hello jack that's all right good day myles j j o'molloy said letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file is that canada swindle case on today the telephone whirred inside twentyeight no twenty double four yes spot the winner lenehan came out of the inner office with sport's tissues who wants a dead cert for the gold cup he asked sceptre with o madden up he tossed the tissues on to the table screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open hush lenehan said i hear feetstoops professor machugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps the tissues rustled up in the draught floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth it wasn't me sir it was the big fellow shoved me sir throw him out and shut the door the editor said there's a hurricane blowing lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor grunting as he stooped twice waiting for the racing special sir the newsboy said it was pat farrell shoved me sir he pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe him sir out of this with you professor machugh said gruffly he hustled the boy out and banged the door to j j o'molloy turned the files crackingly over murmuring seeking continued on page six column four yes evening telegraph here mr bloom phoned from the inner office is the boss yes telegraph to where aha which auction rooms aha i see right i'll catch him a collision ensues the bell whirred again as he rang off he came in quickly and bumped against lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue pardon monsieur lenehan said clutching him for an instant and making a grimace my fault mr bloom said suffering his grip are you hurt i'm in a hurry knee lenehan said he made a comic face and whined rubbing his knee the accumulation of the anno domini sorry mr bloom said he went to the door and holding it ajar paused j j o'molloy slapped the heavy pages over the noise of two shrill voices a mouthorgan echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps we are the boys of wexford who fought with heart and hand exit bloom i'm just running round to bachelor's walk mr bloom said about this ad of keyes's want to fix it up they tell me he's round there in dillon's he looked indecisively for a moment at their faces the editor who leaning against the mantelshelf had propped his head on his hand suddenly stretched forth an arm amply begone he said the world is before you back in no time mr bloom said hurrying out j j o'molloy took the tissues from lenehan's hand and read them blowing them apart gently without comment he'll get that advertisement the professor said staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind look at the young scamps after him show where lenehan cried running to the window a street cortege both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in mr bloom's wake the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite a tail of white bowknots look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry lenehan said and you'll kick o my rib risible taking off his flat spaugs and the walk small nines steal upon larks he began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to j j o'molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands what's that myles crawford said with a start where are the other two gone who the professor said turning they're gone round to the oval for a drink paddy hooper is there with jack hall came over last night come on then myles crawford said where's my hat he walked jerkily into the office behind parting the vent of his jacket jingling his keys in his back pocket they jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer he's pretty well on professor machugh said in a low voice seems to be j j o'molloy said taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation but it is not always as it seems who has the most matches the calumet of peace he offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn j j o'molloy opened his case again and offered it thanky vous lenehan said helping himself the editor came from the inner office a straw hat awry on his brow he declaimed in song pointing sternly at professor machugh twas rank and fame that tempted thee twas empire charmed thy heart the professor grinned locking his long lips eh you bloody old roman empire myles crawford said he took a cigarette from the open case lenehan lighting it for him with quick grace said silence for my brandnew riddle imperium romanum j j o'molloy said gently it sounds nobler than british or brixton the word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire myles crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling that's it he said we are the fat you and i are the fat in the fire we haven't got the chance of a snowball in hell the grandeur that was rome wait a moment professor machugh said raising two quiet claws we mustn't be led away by words by sounds of words we think of rome imperial imperious imperative he extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs pausing what was their civilisation vast i allow but vile cloacae sewers the jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said it is meet to be here let us build an altar to jehovah the roman like the englishman who follows in his footsteps brought to every new shore on which he set his foot on our shore he never set it only his cloacal obsession he gazed about him in his toga and he said it is meet to be here let us construct a watercloset which they accordingly did do lenehan said our old ancient ancestors as we read in the first chapter of guinness's were partial to the running stream they were nature's gentlemen j j o'molloy murmured but we have also roman law and pontius pilate is its prophet professor machugh responded do you know that story about chief baron palles j j o'molloy asked it was at the royal university dinner everything was going swimmingly first my riddle lenehan said are you ready mr o'madden burke tall in copious grey of donegal tweed came in from the hallway stephen dedalus behind him uncovered as he entered entrez mes enfants lenehan cried i escort a suppliant mr o'madden burke said melodiously youth led by experience visits notoriety how do you do the editor said

geese o yes every time don't you forget that the moot point is did he forget it j j o'molloy said quietly turning a horseshoe paperweight saving princes is a thank you job professor machugh turned on him and if not he said i'll tell you how it was myles crawford began a hungarian it was one day lost causes noble marquess mentioned we were always loyal to lost causes the professor said success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination we were never loyal to the successful we serve them i teach the blatant latin language i speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim time is money material domination dominus lord where is the spirituality lord jesus lord salisbury a sofa in a westend club but the greek kyrie eleison a smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes lengthened his long lips the greek he said again kyrios shining word the vowels the semite and the saxon know not kyrie the radiance of the intellect i ought to profess greek the language of the mind kyrie eleison the closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit we are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of europe that foundered at trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit not an imperium that went under with the athenian fleets at aegospotami yes yes they went under pyrrhus misled by an oracle made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of greece loyal to a lost cause he strode away from them towards the window they went forth to battle mr o'madden burke said greyly but they always fell boohoo lenehan wept with a little noise owing to a brick received in the latter half of the matinée poor poor poor pyrrhus he whispered then near stephen's ear lenehan's limerick there's a ponderous pundit machugh who wears goggles of ebony hue as he mostly sees double to wear them why trouble i can't see the joe miller can you in mourning for sallust mulligan says whose mother is beastly dead myles crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket that'll be all right he said i'll read the rest after that'll be all right lenehan extended his hands in protest but my riddle he said what opera is like a railwayline opera mr o'madden burke's sphinx face reriddled lenehan announced gladly the rose of castile see the wheeze rows of cast steel gee he poked mr o'madden burke mildly in the spleen mr o'madden burke fell back with grace on his umbrella feigning a gasp help he sighed i feel a strong weakness lenehan rising to tiptoe fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues the professor returning by way of the files swept his hand across stephen's and mr o'madden burke's loose ties paris past and present he said you look like communards like fellows who had blown up the bastile j j o'molloy said in quiet mockery or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of finland between you you look as though you had done the deed general bobrikoff omnium gatherum we were only thinking about it stephen said all the talents myles crawford said law the classics the turf lenehan put in literature the press if bloom were here the professor said the gentle art of advertisement and madam bloom mr o'madden burke added the vocal muse dublin's prime

press and his american cousin of the bowery guttersheet not to mention paddy kelly's budget pue's occurrences and our watchful friend the skibbereen eagle why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like whiteside sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof links with bygone days of yore grattan and flood wrote for this very paper the editor cried in his face irish volunteers where are you now established 1763 dr lucas who have you now like john philpot curran psha well j j o'molloy said bushe k c for example bushe the editor said well yes bushe yes he has a strain of it in his blood kendal bushe or i mean seymour bushe he would have been on the bench long ago the professor said only for but no matter j j o'molloy turned to stephen and said quietly and slowly one of the most polished periods i think i ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of seymour bushe it was in that case of fratricide the childs murder case bushe defended him and in the porches of mine ear did pour by the way how did he find that out he died in his sleep or the other story beast with two backs what was that the professor asked italia magistra artium he spoke on the law of evidence j j o'molloy said of roman justice as contrasted with the earlier mosaic code the lex talionis and he cited the moses of michelangelo in the vatican ha a few wellchosen words lenehan prefaced silence pause j j o'molloy took out his cigarettecase false lull something quite ordinary messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar i have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act trivial in itself that striking of that match that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives a polished period j j o'molloy resumed moulding his words he said of it that stony effigy in frozen music horned and terrible of the human form divine that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live deserves to live his slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall fine myles crawford said at once the divine afflatus mr o'madden burke said you like it j j o'molloy asked stephen stephen his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture blushed he took a cigarette from the case j j o'molloy offered his case to myles crawford lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy saying muchibus thankibus a man of high morale professor magennis was speaking to me about you j j o'molloy said to stephen what do you think really of that hermetic crowd the opal hush poets a e the mastermystic that blavatsky woman started it she was a nice old bag of tricks a e has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness magennis thinks you must have been pulling a e s leg he is a man of the very highest morale magennis speaking about me what did he say what did he say what did he say about me don't ask no thanks professor machugh said waving the cigarettecase aside wait a moment let me say one thing the finest display of oratory i ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical society mr justice fitzgibbon the present lord justice of appeal had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay new for those days advocating the revival of the irish tongue he turned towards myles crawford and said you know gerald fitzgibbon then you can imagine the style of his discourse he is sitting with tim healy j j o'molloy said rumour has it on the trinity college estates commission he is sitting with a sweet thing myles crawford said in a child's frock go on well it was the speech mark you the professor said of a finished orator full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction i will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man's contumely upon the new movement it was then a new movement we were weak therefore worthless he closed his long thin lips an instant but eager to be on raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims steadied them to a new focus impromptu in ferial tone he addressed j j o'molloy taylor had come there you must know from a sickbed that he had prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall his dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it he wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked though he was not a dying man his gaze turned at once but slowly from j j o'molloy's towards stephen's face and then bent at once to the ground seeking his unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head soiled by his withering hair still seeking he said when fitzgibbon's speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply briefly as well as i can bring them to mind his words were these he raised his head firmly his eyes bethought themselves once more witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro seeking outlet he began mr chairman ladies and gentlemen great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment since by my learned friend it seemed to me that i had been transported into a country far away from this country into an age remote from this age that i stood in ancient egypt and that i was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful moses his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech and let our crooked smokes noble words coming look out could you try your hand at it yourself and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride i heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me from the fathers it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted ah curse you that's saint augustine why will you jews not accept our culture our religion and our language you are a tribe of nomad herdsmen we are a mighty people you have no cities nor no wealth our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys trireme and quadrireme laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe you have but emerged from primitive conditions we have a literature a priesthood an agelong history and a polity nile child man effigy by the nilebank the babemaries kneel cradle of bulrushes a man supple in combat stonehorned stonebearded heart of stone you pray to a local and obscure idol our temples majestic and mysterious are the abodes of isis and osiris of horus and ammon ra yours serfdom awe and humbleness ours thunder and the seas israel is weak and few are her children egypt is an host and terrible are her arms vagrants and daylabourers are you called the world trembles at our name a dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech he lifted his voice above it boldly but ladies and gentlemen had the youthful moses listened to and accepted that view of life had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day he would never have spoken with the eternal amid lightnings on sinai's mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law graven in the language of the outlaw he ceased and looked at them enjoying a silence ominous for him j j o'molloy said not without regret and yet he died without having entered the land of promise a sudden at the moment though from lingering illness often previously expectorated demise lenehan added and with a great future behind him the troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase that is oratory the professor said uncontradicted gone with the wind hosts at mullaghmast and tara of the kings miles of ears of porches the tribune's words howled and scattered to the four winds a people sheltered within his voice dead noise akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was love and laud him me no more i have money gentlemen stephen said as the next motion on the agenda paper may i suggest that the house do now adjourn you take my breath away it is not perchance a french compliment mr o'madden burke asked tis the hour methinks when the winejug metaphorically speaking is most grateful in ye ancient hostelry that it be and hereby is resolutely resolved all that are in favour say ay lenehan announced the contrary no i declare it carried to which particular boosing shed my casting vote is mooney's he led the way admonishing we will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters will we not yes we will not by no manner of means mr o'madden burke following close said with an ally's lunge of his umbrella lay on macduff chip of the old block the editor cried clapping stephen on the shoulder let us go where are those blasted keys he fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets foot and mouth i know that'll be all right that'll go in where are they that's all right he thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office let us hope j j o'molloy about to follow him in said quietly to stephen i hope you will live to see it published myles one moment he went into the inner office closing the door behind him come along stephen the professor said that is fine isn't it it has the prophetic vision fuit ilium the sack of windy troy kingdoms of this world the masters of the mediterranean are fellaheen today the first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street yelling racing special dublin i have much much to learn they turned to the left along abbey street i have a vision too stephen said yes the professor said skipping to get into step crawford will follow another newsboy shot past them yelling as he ran racing special dear dirty dublin dubliners two dublin vestals stephen said elderly and pious have lived fifty and fiftythree years in fumbally's lane where is that the professor asked off blackpitts stephen said damp night reeking of hungry dough against the wall face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl frantic hearts akasic records quicker darlint on now dare it let there be life they want to see the views of dublin from the top of nelson's pillar they save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox they shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers they put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain wise virgins professor machugh said life on the raw they buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in marlborough street from miss kate collins proprietress they purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of nelson's pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn they give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase grunting encouraging each other afraid of the dark panting one asking the other have you the brawn praising god and the blessed virgin threatening to come down peeping at the airslits glory be to god they had no idea it was that high their names are anne kearns and florence maccabe anne kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on lourdes water given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father florence maccabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double x for supper every saturday antithesis the professor said nodding twice vestal virgins i can see them what's keeping our friend he turned a bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps scattering in all directions yelling their white papers fluttering hard after them myles crawford appeared on the steps his hat aureoling his scarlet face talking with j j o'molloy come along the professor cried waving his arm he set off again to walk by stephen's side return of bloom yes he said i see them mr bloom breathless caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the irish catholic and dublin penny journal called mr crawford a moment telegraph racing special what is it myles crawford said falling back a pace a newsboy cried in mr bloom's face terrible tragedy in rathmines a child bit by a bellows interview with the editor just this ad mr bloom said pushing through towards the steps puffing and taking

he wants it copied if it's not too late i told councillor nannetti from the kilkenny people i can have access to it in the national library house of keys don't you see his name is keyes it's a play on the name but he practically promised he'd give the renewal but he wants just a little puff what will i tell him mr crawford k m a will you tell him he can kiss my arse myles crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis tell him that straight from the stable a bit nervy look out for squalls all off for a drink arm in arm lenehan's yachting cap on the cadge beyond usual blarney wonder is that young dedalus the moving spirit has a good pair of boots on him today last time i saw him he had his heels on view been walking in muck somewhere careless chap what was he doing in irishtown well mr bloom said his eyes returning if i can get the design i suppose it's worth a short par he'd give the ad i think i'll tell him k m r i a he can kiss my royal irish arse myles crawford cried loudly over his shoulder any time he likes tell him while mr bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on jerkily raising the wind nulla bona jack he said raising his hand to his chin i'm up to here i've been through the hoop myself i was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week sorry jack you must take the will for the deed with a heart and a half if i could raise the wind anyhow j j o'molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently they caught up on the others and walked abreast when they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings something for you the professor explained to myles crawford two old dublin women on the top of nelson's pillar some column that's what waddler one said that's new myles crawford said that's copy out for the waxies dargle two old trickies what but they are afraid the pillar will fall stephen went on they see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are rathmines blue dome adam and eve's saint laurence o'toole's but it makes them giddy to look so they pull up their skirts those slightly rambunctious females easy all myles crawford said no poetic licence we're in the archdiocese here and settle down on their striped petticoats peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer onehandled adulterer the professor cried i like that i see the idea i see what you mean dames donate dublin's cits speedpills velocitous aeroliths belief it gives them a crick in their necks stephen said and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak they put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it one after another wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings he gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close lenehan and mr o'madden burke hearing turned beckoned and led on across towards mooney's finished myles crawford said so long as they do no worse sophist wallops haughty helen square on proboscis spartans gnash molars ithacans vow pen is champ you remind me of antisthenes the professor said a disciple of gorgias the sophist it is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself he was the son of a noble and a bondwoman and he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from argive helen and handed it to poor penelope poor penelope penelope rich they made ready to cross o'connell street hello there central at various points along the

see the professor said he laughed richly i see he said again with new pleasure moses and the promised land we gave him that idea he added to j j o'molloy horatio is cynosure this fair june day j j o'molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held his peace i see the professor said he halted on sir john gray's pavement island and peered aloft at nelson through the meshes of his

two of your small jamesons after that and a stone ginger davy byrne added civilly ay paddy leonard said a suckingbottle for the baby mr bloom walked towards dawson street his tongue brushing his teeth smooth something green it would have to be spinach say then with those rontgen rays searchlight you could at duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest surfeit returned with thanks having fully digested the contents first sweet then savoury mr bloom coasted warily ruminants his second course their upper jaw they move wonder if tom rochford will do anything with that invention of his wasting time explaining it to flynn's mouth lean people long mouths ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free

knuckle handy man wants job small wages will eat anything mr bloom turned at gray's confectioner's window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend thomas connellan's bookstore why i left the church of rome birds nest women run him they say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews same bait why we left the church of rome a blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane no tram in sight wants to cross do you want to cross mr bloom asked the blind stripling did not answer his wallface frowned weakly he moved his head uncertainly you're in dawson street mr bloom said molesworth street is opposite do you want to cross there's nothing in the way the cane moved out trembling to the left mr bloom's eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks van drawn up before drago's where i saw his brillantined hair just when i was horse drooping driver in john long's slaking his drouth there's a van there mr bloom said but it's not moving i'll see you across do you want to go to molesworth street yes the stripling answered south frederick street come mr bloom said he touched the thin elbow gently then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward say something to him better not do the condescending they mistrust what you tell them pass a

of herringbone tweed poor young fellow how on earth did he know that van was there must have felt it see things in their forehead perhaps kind of sense of volume weight or size of it something blacker than the dark wonder would he feel it if something was removed feel a gap queer idea of dublin he must have tapping his way round by the stones could he walk in a beeline if he hadn't that cane

shakespeare's hamlet though i admire him as old ben did on this side idolatry all these questions are purely academic russell oracled out of his shadow i mean whether hamlet is shakespeare or james i or essex clergymen's discussions of the historicity of jesus art has to reveal to us ideas formless spiritual essences the supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring the painting of gustave moreau is the painting of ideas the deepest poetry of shelley the words of hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal wisdom plato's world of ideas all the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys a e has been telling some yankee interviewer wall tarnation strike me the schoolmen were schoolboys first stephen said superpolitely aristotle was once plato's schoolboy and has remained so one should hope john eglinton sedately said one can see him a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm he laughed again at the now smiling bearded face

would find hamlet's musings about the afterlife of his princely soul the improbable insignificant and undramatic monologue as shallow as plato's john eglinton frowning said waxing wroth upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare aristotle with plato which of the two stephen asked would have banished me from his commonwealth unsheathe your dagger definitions horseness is the whatness of allhorse streams of tendency and eons they worship god noise in the street very peripatetic space what you damn well have to see through spaces smaller than red globules of man's blood they creepycrawl after blake's buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow hold to the now the here through which all future plunges to the past mr best came forward amiable towards his colleague haines is gone he said is he i was showing him jubainville's book he's quite enthusiastic don't you know about hyde's lovesongs of connacht i couldn't bring him in to hear the discussion he's gone to gill's to buy it bound thee forth my booklet quick to greet the callous public writ i ween twas not my wish in lean unlovely english the peatsmoke is going to his head john

russell warned occultly the movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant's heart on the hillside for them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother the rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel the musichall song france produces the finest flower of corruption in mallarme but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart the life of homer's phaeacians from these words mr best turned an unoffending face to stephen mallarme don't you know he said has written those wonderful prose poems stephen mackenna used to read to me in paris the one about hamlet he says il se promène lisant au livre de lui même don't you know reading the book of himself he describes hamlet given in a french town don't you know a provincial town they advertised it his free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air hamlet ou le distrait pièce de shakespeare he repeated to john eglinton's newgathered frown pièce de shakespeare don't you know it's so french the french point of view hamlet ou the absentminded beggar stephen ended john eglinton laughed yes i suppose it would be he said excellent people no doubt but distressingly shortsighted in some matters sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder a deathsman of the soul robert greene called him stephen said not for nothing was he a butcher's son wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms nine lives are taken off for his father's one our father who art in purgatory khaki hamlets don't hesitate to shoot the bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by mr swinburne cranly i his mute orderly following battles from afar whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none but we had spared between the saxon smile and yankee yawp the devil and the deep sea he will have it that hamlet is a ghoststory john eglinton said for mr best's behoof like the fat boy in pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep list list o list my flesh hears him creeping hears if thou didst ever what is a ghost stephen said with tingling energy one who has faded into impalpability through death through absence through change of manners elizabethan london lay as far from stratford as corrupt paris lies from virgin dublin who is the ghost from limbo patrum returning to the world that has forgotten him who is king hamlet john eglinton shifted his spare body leaning back to judge lifted it is this hour of a day in mid june stephen said begging with a swift glance their hearing the flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside the bear sackerson growls in the pit near it paris garden canvasclimbers who sailed with drake chew their sausages among the groundlings local colour work in all you know make them accomplices shakespeare has left the huguenot's house in silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank but he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes the swan of avon has other thoughts composition of place ignatius loyola make haste to help me the play begins a player comes on under the shadow made up in the castoff mail of a court buck a wellset man with a bass voice it is the ghost the king a king and no king and the player is shakespeare who has studied hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre he speaks the words to burbage the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth calling him by a name hamlet i am thy father's spirit bidding him list to a son he speaks the son of his soul the prince young hamlet and to the son of his body hamnet shakespeare who has died in stratford that his namesake may live for ever is it possible that that player shakespeare a ghost by absence and in the vesture of buried denmark a ghost by death speaking his own words to his own son's name had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been prince hamlet's twin is it possible i want to know or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises you are the dispossessed son i am the murdered father your mother is the guilty queen ann shakespeare born hathaway but this prying into the family life of a great man russell began impatiently art thou there truepenny interesting only to the parish clerk i mean we have the plays i mean when we read the poetry of king lear what is it to us how the poet lived as for living our servants can do that for us villiers de l'isle has said peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day the poet's drinking the poet's debts we have king lear and it is immortal mr best's face appealed to agreed flow over them with your waves and with your waters mananaan

i i and i i a e i o u do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries john eglinton's carping voice asked her ghost at least has been laid for ever she died for literature at least before she was born she died stephen retorted sixtyseven years after she was born she saw him into and out of the world she took his first embraces she bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed mother's deathbed candle the sheeted mirror who brought me into this world lies there bronzelidded under few cheap flowers liliata rutilantium i wept alone john eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp the world believes that shakespeare made a mistake he said and got out of it as quickly and as best he could bosh stephen said rudely a man of genius makes no mistakes his errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian softcreakfooted bald eared and assiduous a shrew john eglinton said shrewdly is not a useful portal of discovery one should imagine what useful discovery did socrates learn from xanthippe dialectic stephen answered and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world what he learnt from his other wife myrto absit nomen socratididion's epipsychidion no man not a woman will ever know but neither the midwife's lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of sinn fein and their naggin of hemlock but ann hathaway mr best's quiet voice said forgetfully yes we seem to be forgetting her as shakespeare himself forgot her his look went from brooder's beard to carper's skull to remind to chide them not unkindly then to the baldpink lollard costard guiltless though maligned he had a good groatsworth of wit stephen said and no truant memory he carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to romeville whistling the girl i left behind me if the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor wat sitting in his form the cry of hounds the studded bridle and her blue windows that memory venus and adonis lay in the bedchamber of every light of love in london is katharine the shrew illfavoured hortensio calls her young and beautiful do you think the writer of antony and cleopatra a passionate pilgrim had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all warwickshire to lie withal good he left her and gained the world of men but his boywomen are the women of a boy their life thought speech are lent them by males he chose badly he was chosen it seems to me if others have their will ann hath a way by cock she was to blame she put the comether on him sweet and twentysix the greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy adonis stooping to conquer as prologue to the swelling act is a boldfaced stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself and my turn when come ryefield mr best said brightly gladly raising his new book gladly brightly he murmured then with blond delight for all between the acres of the rye these pretty countryfolk would lie paris the wellpleased pleaser a tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its cooperative watch i am afraid i am due at the homestead whither away exploitable ground are you going john eglinton's active eyebrows asked shall we see you at moore's tonight piper is coming

we are to have a literary surprise the quaker librarian said friendly and earnest mr russell rumour has it is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets verses we are all looking forward anxiously anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces lighted shone see this remember stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen hung on his ashplanthandle over his knee my casque and sword touch lightly with two index fingers aristotle's experiment one or two necessity is that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise argal one hat is one hat listen young colum and starkey george roberts is doing the commercial part longworth will give it a good puff in the express o will he i liked colum's drover yes i think he has that queer thing genius do you

bullockbefriending synge has promised me an article for dana too are we going to be read i feel we are the gaelic league wants something in irish i hope you will come round tonight bring starkey stephen sat down the quaker librarian came from the leavetakers blushing his mask said mr dedalus your views are most illuminating he creaked to and fro tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine and covered by the noise of outgoing said low is it your view then that she was not faithful to the poet alarmed face asks me why did he come courtesy or an inward light where there is a reconciliation stephen said there must have been first a sundering yes christfox in leather trews hiding a runaway in blighted treeforks from hue and cry knowing no vixen walking lonely in the chase women he won to him tender people a whore of babylon ladies of justices bully tapsters wives fox and geese and in new place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely once as sweet as fresh as cinnamon now her leaves falling all bare frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven yes so you think the door closed behind the outgoer rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell rest of warm and brooding air a vestal's lamp here he ponders things that were not what caesar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer what might have been possibilities of the possible as possible things not known what name achilles bore when he lived among women coffined thoughts around me in mummycases embalmed in spice of words thoth god of libraries a birdgod moonycrowned and i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest in painted chambers loaded with tilebooks they are still once quick in the brains of men still but an itch of death is in them to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale urge me to wreak their will certainly john eglinton mused of all great men he is the most enigmatic we know nothing but that he lived and suffered not even so much others abide our question a shadow hangs over all the rest but hamlet is so personal isn't it mr best pleaded i mean a kind of private paper don't you know of his private life i mean i don't care a button don't you know who is killed or who is guilty he rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk smiling his defiance his private papers in the original ta an bad ar an tir taim in mo shagart put beurla on it littlejohn quoth littlejohn eglinton i was prepared for paradoxes from what malachi mulligan told us but i may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that shakespeare is hamlet you have a stern task before you bear with me stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows a basilisk e quando vede l'uomo l'attosca messer brunetto i thank thee for the word as we or mother dana weave and unweave our bodies stephen said from day to day their molecules shuttled to and fro so does the artist weave and unweave his image and as the mole on my right breast is where it was when i was born though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth in the intense instant of imagination when the mind shelley says is a fading coal that which i was is that which i am and that which in possibility i may come to be so in the future the sister of the past i may see myself as i sit here now but by reflection from that which then i shall be drummond of hawthornden helped you at that stile yes mr best said youngly i feel hamlet quite young the bitterness might be from the father but the passages with ophelia are surely from the son has the wrong sow by the lug he is in my father i am in his son that mole is the last to go stephen said laughing john eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow if that were the birthmark of genius he said genius would be a drug in the market the plays of shakespeare's later years which renan admired so much breathe another spirit the spirit of reconciliation the quaker librarian breathed there can be no reconciliation stephen said if there has not been a sundering said that if you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of king lear othello hamlet troilus and cressida look to see when and how the shadow lifts what softens the heart of a man shipwrecked in storms dire tried like another ulysses pericles prince of tyre head redconecapped buffeted brineblinded a child a girl placed in his arms marina the leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity john

material and moral such an appeal will touch him the images of other males of his blood will repel him he will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself the benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope i hope mr dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public and we ought to mention another irish commentator mr george bernard shaw nor should we forget mr frank harris his articles on shakespeare in the saturday review were surely brilliant oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets the favoured rival is william herbert earl of pembroke i own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with what shall i say our notions of what ought not to have been felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them auk's egg prize of their fray he thous and thees her with grave husbandwords dost love miriam dost love thy man that may be too stephen said there's a saying of goethe's which mr magee likes to quote beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life why does he send to one who is a buonaroba a bay where all men ride a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood a lordling to woo for him he was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written romeo and juliet why belief in himself has been untimely killed he was overborne in a cornfield first ryefield i should say and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down assumed dongiovannism will not save him no later undoing will undo the first undoing the tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding if the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman's invisible weapon there is i feel in the words some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion a darker shadow of the first darkening even his own understanding of himself a like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool they list and in the porches of their ears i pour the soul has been before stricken mortally a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear but those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come the poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it king hamlet's ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator that is why the speech his lean unlovely english is always turned elsewhere backward ravisher and ravished what he would but would not go with him from lucrece's bluecircled ivory globes to imogen's breast bare with its mole cinquespotted he goes back weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself an old dog licking an old sore but because loss is his gain he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed his beaver is up he is a ghost a shadow now the wind by elsinore's rocks or what you will the sea's voice a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his

stephen said took the palm of beauty from kyrios menelaus brooddam argive helen the wooden mare of troy in whom a score of heroes slept and handed it to poor penelope twenty years he lived in london

walks one life is all one body do but do afar in a reek of lust and squalor hands are laid on whiteness buck mulligan rapped john eglinton's desk sharply whom do you suspect he challenged say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets once spurned twice spurned but the court wanton spurned him for a lord his dearmylove love that dare not speak its name as an englishman you mean john sturdy eglinton put in he loved a lord old wall where sudden lizards flash at charenton i watched them it seems so stephen said when he wants to do for him and for all other and singular uneared wombs the holy office an ostler does for the stallion maybe like socrates he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife but she the giglot wanton did not break a bedvow two deeds are rank in that ghost's mind a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined deceased husband's brother sweet ann i take it was hot in the blood once a wooer twice a wooer stephen turned boldly in his chair the burden of proof is with you not with me he said frowning if you deny that in the fifth scene of hamlet he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him all those women saw their men down and under mary her goodman john ann her poor dear willun when he went and died on her

killed her first o yes mention there is in the years when he was living richly in royal london to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father's shepherd explain you then explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity he faced their silence to whom thus eglinton you mean the will but that has been explained i believe by jurists she was entitled to her widow's dower at common law his legal knowledge was great our judges tell us him satan fleers mocker and therefore he left out her name from the first draft but he did not leave out the presents for his granddaughter for his daughters for his sister for his old cronies in stratford and in london and therefore when he was urged as i believe to name her he left her his secondbest bed punkt leftherhis secondbest leftherhis bestabed secabest leftabed woa pretty countryfolk had few chattels then john eglinton observed as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type he was a rich country gentleman stephen said with a coat of arms and landed estate at stratford and a house in ireland yard a capitalist shareholder a bill promoter a tithefarmer why did he not leave her his best bed if he

what dowden said what asked besteglinton william shakespeare and company limited the people's william for terms apply e dowden highfield house lovely buck mulligan suspired amorously i asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard he lifted his hands and said all we can say is that life ran very high in those days lovely catamite the sense of beauty leads us astray said beautifulinsadness best to ugling eglinton steadfast john replied severe the doctor can tell us what those words mean you cannot eat your cake and have it sayest thou so will they wrest from us from me the palm of beauty and the sense of property stephen said he drew shylock out of his own long pocket the son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots his borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by chettle falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing he sued a fellowplayer for the

said whose gorbellied works i enjoy reading in the original writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new viennese school mr magee spoke of likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions he means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who it may be hungers for it jews whom christians tax with avarice are of all races the most given to intermarriage accusations are made in anger the christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews for whom as for the lollards storm was shelter bound their affections

mulligan antiphoned gentle will is being roughly handled gentle mr best said gently which will gagged sweetly buck mulligan we are getting mixed the will to live john eglinton philosophised for poor

stephen said battling against hopelessness is a necessary evil he wrote the play in the months that followed his father's death if you hold that he a greying man with two marriageable daughters with thirtyfive years of life nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita with fifty of experience is the beardless undergraduate from wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen no the corpse of john shakespeare does not walk the night from hour to hour it rots and rots he rests disarmed of fatherhood having devised that mystical estate upon his son boccaccio's calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with child fatherhood in the sense of conscious begetting is unknown to man it is a mystical estate an apostolic succession from only begetter to

in the comedy of errors wrote hamlet he was not the father of his own son merely but being no more a son he was and felt himself the father of all his race the father of his own grandfather the father

marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize best of best brothers good better best the quaker librarian springhalted near i should like to know he said which brother you i understand you to

acts of that play hang limply from that first of all his kings richard is the only king unshielded by shakespeare's reverence the angel of the world why is the underplot of king lear in which edmund figures lifted out of sidney's arcadia and spatchcocked on to a celtic legend older than history that was will's way john eglinton defended we should not now combine a norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by george meredith que voulez vous moore would say he puts bohemia on the seacoast and makes ulysses quote aristotle why stephen answered himself because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to shakespeare what the poor are not always with him the note of banishment banishment from the heart banishment from home sounds uninterruptedly from the two gentlemen of verona onward till prospero breaks his staff buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book it doubles itself in the middle of his life reflects itself in another repeats itself protasis epitasis catastasis catastrophe it repeats itself again when he is near the grave when his married daughter susan chip of the old block is accused of adultery but it was the original sin that darkened his understanding weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil the words are those of my lords bishops of maynooth an original sin and like original sin committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned it is between the lines of his last written words it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid age has not withered it beauty and peace have not done it away it is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created in much ado about nothing twice in as you like it in the tempest in hamlet in measure for measure and in all the other plays which i have not read he laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage judge eglinton summed up the truth is midway he affirmed he is the ghost and the prince he is all in all he is stephen said the boy of act one is the mature man of act five all in all in cymbeline in othello he is bawd and cuckold he acts and is acted on lover of an ideal or a perversion like jose he kills the real carmen his unremitting intellect is the hornmad iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer cuckoo cuckoo cuck mulligan clucked lewdly o word of fear dark dome received reverbed and what a character is iago undaunted john eglinton exclaimed when all is said dumas fils or is it dumas père is right after god shakespeare has created most man delights him not nor woman neither stephen said he returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born where he has always been man and boy a silent witness and there his journey of life ended he plants his mulberrytree in the earth then dies the motion is ended gravediggers bury hamlet père and hamlet fils a king and a prince at last in death with incidental music and what though murdered and betrayed bewept by all frail tender hearts for dane or dubliner sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced if you like the epilogue look long on

three just nice time to walk to artane what was that boy's name again dignam yes vere dignum et iustum est brother swan was the person to see mr cunningham's letter yes oblige him if possible good practical catholic useful at mission time a onelegged sailor swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches growled some notes he jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend john conmee s j father conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held he knew one silver crown father conmee crossed to mountjoy square he thought but not for long of soldiers and sailors whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs ending their days in some pauper ward and of cardinal wolsey's words if i had served my god as i have served my king he would not have abandoned me in my old days he walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves and towards him came the wife of mr david sheehy m p very well indeed father and you father father conmee was wonderfully well indeed he would go to buxton probably for the waters and her boys were they getting on well at belvedere was that so father conmee was very glad indeed to hear that and mr sheehy himself still in london the house was still sitting to be sure it was beautiful weather it was delightful indeed yes it was very probable that father bernard vaughan would come again to preach o yes a very great success a wonderful man really father conmee was very glad to see the wife of mr david sheehy m p iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to mr david sheehy m p yes he would certainly call good afternoon mrs sheehy father conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled as he took leave at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun and smiled yet again in going he had cleaned his teeth he knew with arecanut paste father conmee walked and walking smiled for he thought on father bernard vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice pilate wy don't you old back that owlin mob a zealous man however really he was and really did great good in his way beyond a doubt he loved ireland he said and he loved the irish of good family too would one think it welsh were they not o lest he forget that letter to father provincial father conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of mountjoy square yes they were from belvedere the little house aha and were they good boys at school o that was very good now and what was his name jack sohan and his name ger gallaher and the other little man his name was brunny lynam o that was a very nice name to have father conmee gave a letter from his breast to master brunny lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of fitzgibbon street but mind you don't post yourself into the box little man he said the boys sixeyed father conmee and laughed o sir well let me see if you can post a letter father conmee said master brunny lynam ran across the road and put father conmee's letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox father conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along mountjoy square east mr denis j maginni professor of dancing &c in silk hat slate frockcoat with silk facings white kerchief tie tight lavender trousers canary gloves and pointed patent boots walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady maxwell at the corner of dignam's court was that not mrs m'guinness mrs m'guinness stately silverhaired bowed to father conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed and father conmee smiled and saluted how did she do a fine carriage she had like mary queen of scots something and to think that she was a pawnbroker well now such a what should he say such a queenly mien father conmee walked down great charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left the reverend t r greene b a will d v speak the incumbent they called him he felt it incumbent on him to say a few words but one should be charitable invincible ignorance they acted according to their lights father conmee turned the corner and walked along the north circular road it was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare surely there ought to be a band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from richmond street all raised untidy caps father conmee greeted them more than once benignly christian brother boys father conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked saint joseph's church portland row for aged and virtuous females father conmee raised his hat to the blessed sacrament virtuous but occasionally they were also badtempered near aldborough house father conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman and now it was an office or something father conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted by mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop father conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter he passed grogan's the tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in new york in america those things were continually happening unfortunate people to die like that unprepared still an act of perfect contrition father conmee went by daniel bergin's publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged they saluted him and were saluted father conmee passed h j o'neill's funeral establishment where corny kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay a constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted the constable in youkstetter's the porkbutcher's father conmee observed pig's puddings white and black and red lie neatly curled in tubes moored under the trees of charleville mall father conmee saw a turfbarge a towhorse with pendent head a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him it was idyllic and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee s j of saint francis xavier's church upper gardiner street stepped on to an outward bound tram off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley c c of saint agatha's church north william street on to newcomen bridge at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap father conmee liked cheerful decorum it was a peaceful day the gentleman with the glasses opposite father conmee had finished explaining and looked down his wife father conmee supposed a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses she raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gently tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily sweetly father conmee perceived her perfume in the car he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head at annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight the conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her she passed out with her basket and a marketnet and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and father conmee thought that as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you my child that they have been absolved pray for me but they had so many worries in life so many cares poor creatures from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at father conmee father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver s j and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night that book by the belgian jesuit le nombre des Élus seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea those were millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to whom the faith had not d v been brought but they were god's souls created by god it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost a waste if one might say at the howth road stop father conmee alighted was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn the malahide road was quiet it pleased father conmee road and name the joybells were ringing in gay malahide lord talbot de malahide immediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining then came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one day those were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old times in the barony father conmee walking thought of his little book old times in the barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of mary rochfort daughter of lord molesworth first countess of belvedere a listless lady no more young walked alone the shore of lough ennel mary first countess of belvedere listlessly walking in the evening not startled when an otter plunged who could know the truth not the jealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris with her husband's brother she would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did only god knew and she and he her husband's brother father conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence needed however for man's race on earth and of the ways of god which were not our ways don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore he was humane and honoured there he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom ceiled with full fruit clusters and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom noble to noble were impalmed by don john conmee it was a charming day the lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages curtseying to him with ample underleaves the sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind moutonner the french said a just and homely word father conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoning clouds over rathcoffey his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of clongowes field he walked there reading in the evening and heard the cries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet evening he was their rector his reign was mild father conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out an ivory bookmark told him the page nones he should have read that before lunch but lady maxwell had come father conmee read in secret pater and ave and crossed his breast deus in adiutorium he walked calmly and read mutely the nones walking and reading till he came to res in beati immaculati principium verborum tuorum veritas in eternum omnia indicia iustitiae tuae a flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand the young man raised his cap abruptly the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig father conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary sin principes persecuti sunt me gratis et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum corny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner he pulled himself erect went to it and spinning it on its axle viewed its shape and brass furnishings chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway there he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase looking idly out father john conmee stepped into the dollymount tram on newcomen bridge corny kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed his hat downtilted chewing his blade of hay constable 57c on his beat stood to pass the time of day that's a fine day mr kelleher ay corny kelleher said it's very close the constable said corny kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in eccles street flung forth a coin what's the best news he asked i seen that particular party last evening the constable said with bated breath a onelegged sailor crutched himself round macconnell's corner skirting rabaiotti's icecream car and jerked himself up eccles street towards larry o'rourke in shirtsleeves in his doorway he growled unamiably for england he swung himself violently forward past katey and boody dedalus halted and growled home and beauty j j o'molloy's white careworn face was told that mr lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor a stout lady stopped took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her the sailor grumbled thanks glanced sourly at the unheeding windows sank his head and swung himself forward four strides he halted and growled angrily for england two barefoot urchins sucking long liquorice laces halted near him gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths he swung himself forward in vigorous jerks halted lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply home and beauty the gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two ceased the blind of the window was drawn aside a card unfurnished apartments slipped from the sash and fell a plump bare generous arm shone was seen held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps a woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings it fell on the path one of the urchins ran to it picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel's cap saying there sir katey and boody dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen did you put in the books boody asked maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow they wouldn't give anything on them she said father conmee walked through clongowes fields his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble where did you try boody asked m'guinness's boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table bad cess to her big face she cried katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes what's in the pot she asked shirts maggy said boody cried angrily crickey is there nothing for us to eat katey lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt asked and what's in this a heavy fume gushed in answer peasoup maggy said where did you get it katey asked sister mary patrick maggy said the lacquey rang his bell barang boody sat down at the table and said hungrily give us it here maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl katey sitting opposite boody said quietly as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs a good job we have that much where's dilly gone to meet father maggy said boody

uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall at their feet its red speck died and mouldy air closed round them how interesting a refined accent said in the gloom yes sir ned lambert said heartily we are standing in the historic council chamber of saint mary's abbey where silken thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534 this is the most historic spot in all dublin o'madden burke is going to write something about it one of these days the old bank of ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews temple was here too before they built their

whenever you like next week say can you see yes yes good afternoon mr lambert very pleased to have met you pleasure is mine sir ned lambert answered he followed his guest to the outlet and then

read the card in his hand the reverend hugh c love rathcoffey present address saint michael's sallins nice young chap he is he's writing a book about the fitzgeralds he told me he's well up in history

mouth and head far back he stood still and after an instant sneezed loudly chow he said blast you the dust from those sacks j j o'molloy said politely no ned lambert gasped i caught a cold night

nolan came down again from the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass parliament street harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes not quickly in saddles of the leaders leaping leaders rode outriders what was it martin cunningham asked as they went on up the staircase the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of ireland john wyse nolan answered from the stairfoot as they trod across the thick carpet buck mulligan whispered behind his panama to haines parnell's brother there in the corner they chose a small table near the window opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard is that he haines asked twisting round in his seat yes mulligan said that's john howard his brother our city marshal john howard parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested an instant after under its screen his eyes looked quickly ghostbright at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner i'll take a mélange haines said to the waitress two mélanges buck mulligan said and bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well when she had gone he said laughing we call it d b c because they have damn bad cakes o but you missed dedalus on hamlet haines opened his newbought book i'm sorry he said shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance the onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 nelson street england expects buck mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter you should see him he said when his body loses its balance wandering aengus i call him i am sure he has an idée fixe haines said pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger now i am speculating what it would be likely to be such persons always have buck mulligan bent across the table gravely they drove his wits astray he said by visions of hell he will never capture the attic note the note of swinburne of all poets the white death and the ruddy birth that is his tragedy he can never be a poet the joy of creation eternal punishment haines said nodding curtly i see i tackled him this morning on belief there was something on his mind i saw it's rather interesting because professor pokorny of vienna makes an interesting point out of that buck mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come he helped her to unload her tray he can find no trace of hell in ancient irish myth haines said amid the cheerful cups the moral idea seems lacking the sense of destiny of retribution rather strange he should have just that fixed idea does he write anything for your movement he sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream buck mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith he bit off a soft piece hungrily ten years he said chewing and laughing he is going to write something in ten years seems a long way off haines said thoughtfully lifting his spoon still i shouldn't wonder if he did after all he tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup this is real irish cream i take it he said with

thoroughly well supplied lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden

princes of unfettered munster and of connacht the just and of smooth sleek leinster and of cruahan's land and of armagh the splendid and of the noble district of boyle princes the sons of kings and there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for o'connell fitzsimon takes toll of them a chieftain descended from chieftains thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields flaskets of cauliflowers floats

towser by the scruff of the neck and by jesus he near throttled him the figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ulex europeus the widewinged nostrils from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest the eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower a powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble he wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes beneath this he wore trews of deerskin roughly stitched with gut his nether extremities were encased in high balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet

a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage fairest of her race little alf bergan popped in round the door and hid behind barney's snug squeezed up with the laughing and who was sitting up there in the corner that i hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only bob doran

terry boy says alf terence o'ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers bungiveagh and bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats cunning as the sons of deathless leda for they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil those cunning brothers lords of the vat then did you chivalrous terence hand forth as to the manner born that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted the soul of chivalry in beauty akin to the immortals but he the young chief of the o'bergan's could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor

increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels in reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana alavatar hatakalda wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that mars and jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power it was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was we greet you friends of earth who are still in the body mind c k doesn't pile it on it was ascertained that the reference was to mr cornelius kelleher manager of messrs h j o'neill's popular funeral establishment a personal friend of the defunct who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good he stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction he is gone from mortal haunts o'dignam sun of our morning fleet was his foot on the bracken patrick of the beamy brow wail banba with your wind and wail o ocean with your whirlwind there he is again says the citizen staring out who says i bloom says he he's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes and begob i saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again little alf was knocked bawways faith he was good christ says he i could have sworn it was him and says bob doran with the hat on the back

well says alf trying to pass it off he's over all his troubles but bob doran shouts out of him he's a bloody ruffian i say to take away poor little willy dignam terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises and bob doran starts doing the weeps about paddy dignam true as you're there the finest man says he snivelling the finest purest character the tear is bloody near your eye talking through his bloody hat fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married mooney the bumbailiff's daughter mother kept a kip in hardwicke street that used to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her exposing her person open to all comers fair field and no favour the noblest the truest says he and he's gone poor little willy poor little paddy dignam and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round the door come in come on he won't eat you says the citizen so bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks terry was martin cunningham there o christ m'keown says joe reading one of the letters listen to this will you and he starts reading out one 7 hunter street liverpool to the high sheriff of dublin dublin honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged joe gann in bootle jail on the 12 of febuary 1900 and i hanged show us joe says i private arthur chace for

too says the citizen and the dirty scrawl of the wretch says joe here says he take them to hell out of my sight alf hello bloom says he what will you have so they started arguing about the point bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar gob he's a prudent member and no mistake give us one of your prime stinkers terry says joe and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it they're all barbers says he from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses and he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull in the dark land they bide the vengeful knights of the razor their deadly coil they grasp yea and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so saith the lord so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time i'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on there's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on says alf what's that says joe the poor bugger's tool that's being hanged says alf that so says joe god's truth says alf i heard that from the head warder that was in kilmainham when they hanged joe brady the invincible he told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker ruling passion strong in death says joe as someone said that can be explained by science says bloom it's only a natural phenomenon don't you see because on account of the and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would according to the best approved tradition of medical science be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this that and the other talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him give us the paw give the paw doggy good old doggy give the paw here give us the paw arrah bloody end to the paw he'd paw and alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog give you the bloody pip then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a jacobs tin he told terry to bring gob he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more near ate the tin and all hungry bloody mongrel and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point the brothers sheares and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet and die for your country the tommy moore touch about sara curran and she's far from the land and bloom of course with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face phenomenon the fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley time they were stopping up in the city arms pisser burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and by the holy farmer he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings if the three women didn't near roast him it's a queer story the old one bloom's wife and mrs o'dowd that kept the hotel jesus i had to laugh at pisser burke taking them off chewing the fat and bloom with his but don't you see and but on the other hand and sure more be token the lout i'm told was in power's after the blender's round in cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment phenomenon the memory of the dead says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at bloom ay ay says joe you don't grasp my point says bloom what i mean is sinn fein says the citizen sinn fein amhain the friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us the last farewell was affecting in the extreme from the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance the deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle a torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons a posse of dublin metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by speranza's plaintive muse special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents considerable amusement was caused by the favourite dublin streetsingers l n h n and m ll g n who sang the night before larry was stretched in their usual mirth provoking fashion our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies the children of the male and female foundling hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat the viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by their excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign

to imitate short painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man the arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries hoch banzai eljen zivio chinchin polla kronia hiphip vive allah amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song a high double f recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers was easily distinguishable it was exactly seventeen o'clock the signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of rienzi being removed by his medical adviser in attendance dr pippi the learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater his cassock above his hoary head and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously as he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office on a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances specially supplied by

replenished to that beneficent institution quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs fried steak and onions done to a nicety delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he with an abnegation rare in these our times rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish immediately acceded to that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers association as a token of his regard and esteem the nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake the hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly sheila my own encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in clonturk park she brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and oblivious of the dreadful present they both laughed heartily all the spectators including the venerable pastor joining in the general merriment that monster audience simply rocked with delight but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time a fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people touched to the inmost core broke into heartrending sobs not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself big strong men officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal irish constabulary were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage a most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young oxford graduate noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex stepped forward and presenting his visiting card bankbook and genealogical tree solicited the hand of the hapless young lady requesting her to name the day and was accepted on the spot every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion and when the gallant young oxonian the bearer by the way of one of the most timehonoured names in albion's history placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds nay even the ster provostmarshal lieutenantcolonel tomkin maxwell ffrenchmullan tomlinson who presided on the sad occasion he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching could not now restrain his natural emotion with his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone god blimey if she aint a clinker that there bleeding tart blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when i sees her cause i thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down limehouse way so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink the curse of ireland antitreating is about the size of it gob he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my maureen lay and there was a fellow with a ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns gob flahoolagh entertainment don't be talking ireland sober is ireland free and then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of and one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females hitting below the belt so howandever as i was saying the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by joe and me i'd train him by kindness so i would if he was my dog give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him afraid he'll bite you says the citizen jeering no says i but he might take my leg for a lamppost so he calls the old dog over what's on you garry says he then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the old towser growling letting on to answer like a duet in the opera such growling you never heard as they let off between them someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances owen garry the exhibition which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system comprises among other achievements the recitation of verse our greatest living phonetic expert wild horses shall not drag it from us has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance the italics are ours to the ranns of ancient celtic bards we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the little sweet branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather as a contributor d o c points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous raftery and of donal macconsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye we subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication the metrical system of the canine original which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the welsh englyn is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour the curse of my curses seven days every day and seven dry thursdays on you barney kiernan has no sup of water to cool my courage and my guts red roaring after lowry's lights so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and gob you could hear him lapping it up a mile off and joe asked him would he have another i will says he a chara to show there's no ill feeling gob he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking arsing around from one pub to another leaving it to your own honour with old giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators entertainment for man and beast and says joe could you make a hole in another pint could a swim duck says i same again terry says joe are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment says he thank you no says bloom as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet martin cunningham don't you see about this insurance of poor dignam's martin asked me to go to the house you see he dignam i mean didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy holy wars says joe laughing that's a good one if old shylock is landed so the wife comes out top dog what well that's a point says bloom for the wife's admirers whose admirers says joe the wife's advisers i mean says bloom then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that dignam owed bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act he was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal hungarian privileged lottery true as you're there o commend me to an israelite royal and privileged hungarian robbery so bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer a finer than poor little willy that's dead to tell her choking with bloody foolery and shaking bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that shake hands brother you're a rogue and i'm another let me said he so far presume upon our acquaintance which however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time is founded as i hope and believe on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour but should i have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness no rejoined the other i appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and i shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that though the errand be one of sorrow this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup then suffer me to take your hand said he the goodness of your heart i feel sure will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy were i to give vent to my feelings would deprive me even of speech and off with him and out trying to walk straight boosed at five o'clock night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the bobby 14a blind to the world

less and her violets nice as pie doing the little lady jack mooney's sister and the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples gob jack made him toe the line told him if he didn't

rightabout and bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue because he was up one time in a knacker's yard walking

forthcoming as to their pathological condition mr allfours tamoshant con honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house i feel i cannot

better is that really a fact says alf yes says bloom that's well known did you not know that so off they started about irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that and of course bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad i declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to bloom look at bloom do you see that straw that's a straw declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady a most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of brian o'ciarnain's in sraid na bretaine bheag under the auspices of sluagh na h eireann on the revival of ancient gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture as understood in ancient greece and ancient rome and ancient ireland for the development of the race the venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions after an instructive discourse by the chairman a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient panceltic forefathers the wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue mr joseph m'carthy hynes made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient gaelic sports and pastimes practised morning and evening by finn maccool as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages l bloom who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal thomas osborne davis evergreen verses happily too familiar to need recalling here a nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself the irish caruso garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it his superb highclass vocalism which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions the proceedings then terminated amongst the clergy present were

hefty battle when myler and percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns handicapped as he was by lack of poundage dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft the final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions the welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose and myler came on looking groggy the soldier got to business leading off with a powerful left jab to which the irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of bennett's jaw the redcoat ducked but the dubliner lifted him with a left hook the body punch being a fine one the men came to handigrips myler quickly became busy and got his man under the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes myler punishing him the englishman whose right eye was nearly closed took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck confident of knocking out the fistic eblanite in jigtime it was a fight to a finish and the best man for it the two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high the referee twice cautioned pucking percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch after a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to battling bennett's stomach flooring him flat it was a knockout clean and clever amid tense expectation the portobello bruiser was being counted out when bennett's second ole pfotts wettstein threw in the towel and the santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight he knows which side his bread is buttered says alf i hear

wind and piss like a tanyard cat cows in connacht have long horns as much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the molly maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant hear hear to that says john wyse what will you have an imperial yeomanry says lenehan to celebrate the occasion half one terry says john wyse and a hands up terry are you asleep yes sir says terry small whisky and bottle of allsop right sir hanging over the bloody paper with alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public picture of a butting match trying to crack their bloody skulls one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate and another one black beast burned in omaha ga a lot of deadwood dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him gob they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job but what about the fighting navy says ned that keeps our foes at bay i'll tell you what about it says the citizen hell upon earth it is read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at portsmouth a fellow writes that calls himself disgusted one so he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out howling for his ma and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun a rump and dozen says the citizen was what that old ruffian sir john beresford called it but the modern god's englishman calls it caning on the breech and says john wyse tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder that's your glorious british navy says the citizen that bosses the earth the fellows that never will be slaves with the only hereditary chamber on the face of god's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons that's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs on which the sun never rises says joe and the tragedy of it is says the citizen they believe it the unfortunate yahoos believe it they believe in rod the scourger almighty creator of hell upon earth and in jacky tar the son of a gun who was conceived of unholy boast born of the fighting navy suffered under rump and dozen was scarified flayed and curried yelled like bloody hell the third day he arose again from the bed steered into haven sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid but says bloom isn't discipline the same everywhere i mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force didn't i tell you as true as i'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living we'll put force against force says the citizen we have our greater ireland beyond the sea they were driven out of house and home in the black 47 their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered saxons there would soon be as few irish in ireland as redskins in america even the grand turk sent us his piastres but the sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the british hyenas bought and sold in rio de janeiro ay they drove out the peasants in hordes twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships but those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage and they will come again and with a vengeance no cravens the sons of granuaile the champions of kathleen ni houlihan perfectly true says bloom but my point was we are a long time waiting for that day citizen says ned since the poor old woman told us that the french were on the sea and landed at killala ay says john wyse we fought for the royal stuarts that reneged us against the williamites and they betrayed us remember limerick and the broken treatystone we gave our best blood to france and spain the wild geese fontenoy eh and sarsfield and o'donnell duke of tetuan in spain and ulysses browne of camus that was fieldmarshal to maria teresa but what did we ever get for it the french says the citizen set of dancing masters do you know what it is they were never worth a roasted fart to ireland aren't they trying to make an entente cordiale now at tay pay's dinnerparty with perfidious albion firebrands of europe and they always were conspuez les français says lenehan nobbling his beer and as for the prooshians and the hanoverians says joe haven't we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from george the elector down to the german lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead jesus i had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her blind drunk in her royal palace every night of god old vic with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about ehren on the rhine and come where the boose is cheaper well says j j we have edward the peacemaker now tell that to a fool says the citizen there's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo edward guelph wettin and what do you think says joe of the holy boys the priests and bishops of ireland doing up his room in maynooth in his satanic majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode the earl of dublin no less they ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself says little alf and says j j considerations of space influenced their lordships decision will you try another citizen says joe yes sir says he i will you says joe beholden to you joe says i may your shadow never grow less repeat that dose says joe bloom was talking and talking with john wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about persecution says he all the history of the world is full of it perpetuating national hatred among nations but do you know what a nation means says john wyse yes says bloom what is it says john wyse a nation says bloom a nation is the same people living in the same place by god then says ned laughing if that's so i'm a nation for i'm living in the same place for the past five years so of course everyone had the laugh at bloom and says he trying to muck out of it or also living in different places that covers my case says joe what is your nation if i may ask says the citizen ireland says bloom i was born here ireland the citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and gob he spat a red bank oyster out of him right in the corner after you with the push joe says he taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry here you are citizen says joe take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words the muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient irish facecloth attributed to solomon of droma and manus tomaltach og macdonogh authors of the book of ballymote was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration no need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces the acme of art wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol a bogoak sceptre a north american puma a far nobler king of beasts than the british article be it said in passing a kerry calf and a golden eagle from carrantuohill the scenes depicted on the emunctory field showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the barmecides glendalough the lovely lakes of killarney the ruins of clonmacnois cong abbey glen inagh and the twelve pins ireland's eye the green hills of tallaght croagh patrick the brewery of messrs arthur guinness son and company limited lough neagh's banks the vale of ovoca isolde's tower the mapas obelisk sir patrick dun's hospital cape clear the

purgatory the salmon leap maynooth college refectory curley's hole the three birthplaces of the first duke of wellington the rock of cashel the bog of allen the henry street warehouse fingal's cave all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time show us over the drink says i which is which that's mine says joe as the devil said to the dead policeman and i belong to a race too says bloom that is hated and persecuted also now this very moment this very instant gob he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar robbed says he plundered insulted persecuted taking what belongs to us by right at this very moment says he putting up his fist sold by auction in morocco like slaves or cattle are you talking about the new jerusalem says the citizen i'm talking about injustice says bloom right says john wyse stand up to it then with force like men that's an almanac picture for you mark for a softnosed bullet old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun gob he'd adorn a sweepingbrush so he would if he only had a nurse's apron on him and then he collapses all of a sudden twisting around all the opposite as limp as a wet rag but it's no use says he force hatred history all that that's not life for men and women insult and hatred and everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life what says alf love says bloom i mean the opposite of hatred i must go now says he to john wyse just round to the court a moment to see if martin is there if he comes just say i'll be back in a second just a moment who's hindering you and off he pops like greased lightning a new apostle to the gentiles says the citizen universal love

round the mouth of his cannon the bible did you read that skit in the united irishman today about that zulu chief that's visiting england what's that says joe so the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out a delegation of the chief cotton magnates of manchester was presented yesterday to his majesty the alaki of abeakuta by gold stick in waiting lord walkup of walkup on eggs to tender to his majesty the heartfelt thanks of british traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions the delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate in the course of a happy speech freely translated by the british chaplain the reverend ananias praisegod barebones tendered his best thanks to massa walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between abeakuta and the british empire stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible the volume of the word of god and the secret of england's greatness graciously presented to him by the white chief woman the great squaw victoria with a personal dedication from the august hand of the royal donor the alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast black and white from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty kakachakachak surnamed forty warts after which he visited the chief factory of cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors book subsequently executing a charming old abeakutic wardance in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks amid hilarious applause from the girl hands widow woman says ned i wouldn't doubt her wonder did he put that bible to the same use as i would same only more so says lenehan and thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished

got back they were at it dingdong john wyse saying it was bloom gave the ideas for sinn fein to griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling irish industries robbing peter to pay paul gob that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show give us a bloody chance god save ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout mr bloom with his argol bargol and his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds old methusalem bloom the robbing

distance no object no security gob he's like lanty machale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with every one well it's a fact says john wyse and there's the man now that'll tell you all about it martin cunningham sure enough the castle car drove up with martin on it and jack power with him and a fellow named crofter or crofton pensioner out of the collector general's an orangeman blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's expense our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys ho varlet cried he who by his mien seemed the leader of the party saucy knave to us so saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice mine host came forth at the summons girding him with his tabard give you good den my masters said he with an obsequious bow bestir thyself sirrah cried he who had knocked look to our steeds and for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need

shall not want for aught the king's friends god bless his majesty shall not go afasting in my house i warrant me then about cried the traveller who had not spoken a lusty trencherman by his aspect hast aught to give us mine host bowed again as he made answer what say you good masters to a squab pigeon pasty some collops of venison a saddle of veal widgeon with crisp hog's bacon a boar's head with pistachios a bason of jolly custard a medlar tansy and a flagon of old rhenish gadzooks cried the last speaker that likes me well pistachios aha cried he of the pleasant countenance a poor house and a bare larder quotha tis a merry rogue so in comes martin asking where was bloom where is he says lenehan defrauding widows and orphans isn't that a fact says john wyse what i was telling the citizen about bloom and the sinn fein that's so says martin or so they allege who made those allegations says alf i says joe i'm the alligator and after all says john wyse why can't a jew love his country like the next fellow why not says j j when he's quite sure which country it is is he a jew or a gentile or a holy roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he says ned or who is he no offence crofton who is junius says j j we don't want him says crofter the orangeman or presbyterian he's a perverted jew says martin from a place in hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the hungarian system we know that in the castle isn't he a cousin of bloom the dentist says jack power not at all says martin only namesakes his name was virag the father's name that poisoned himself

before the wife was delivered en ventre sa mère says j j do you call that a man says the citizen i wonder did he ever put it out of sight says joe well there were two children born anyhow says jack power and who does he suspect says the citizen gob there's many a true word spoken in jest one of those mixed middlings he is lying up in the hotel pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses do you know what i'm telling you it'd be an act of god to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea justifiable homicide so it would then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man give us your blessing not as much as would blind your eye charity to the neighbour says martin but where is he we can't wait a wolf in sheep's clothing says the citizen that's what he is virag from hungary ahasuerus i call him cursed by god have you time for a brief libation martin says ned only one says martin we must

milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set the spinnaker to larboard a many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and clinging to the sides of the noble bark they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair even so did they come and set them those willing nymphs the undying sisters and they laughed sporting in a circle of their foam and the bark clave the waves but begob i was just lowering the heel

perch all the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress

him ben bloom elijah amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over donohoe's in little green street like a shot off a shovel the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand on the proud promontory of dear old howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay on the weedgrown rocks along sandymount shore and last but not least on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man mary star of the sea the three girl friends were seated on the rocks enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine cissy caffrey and edy boardman with the baby in the pushcar and tommy and jacky caffrey two little curlyheaded boys dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name h m s belleisle printed on both for tommy and jacky caffrey were twins scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them they were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets building castles as children do or playing with their big coloured ball happy as the day was long and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight he was but eleven months and nine days old and though still a tiny toddler was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words cissy caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin now baby cissy caffrey said say out big big i want a drink of water and baby prattled after her a jink a jink a jawbo cissy caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children so patient with little sufferers and tommy caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was cissy caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on what a persuasive power that girl had but to be sure baby boardman was as good as gold a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib none of your spoilt beauties flora macflimsy sort was cissy caffrey a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips a girl lovable in the extreme and edy boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother but just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and master jacky boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the martello tower had but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky was selfwilled too and true to the maxim that every little irishman's house is his castle he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and alas to relate the coveted castle too needless to say the cries of discomfited master tommy drew the attention of the girl friends come here tommy his sister called imperatively at once and you jacky for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand wait till i catch you for that his eyes misty with unshed tears master tommy came at her call for their big sister's word was law with the twins and in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure his little man o war top and unmentionables were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life's tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn't be far from him her eyes dancing in admonition nasty bold jacky she cried she put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly what's your name butter and cream tell us who is your sweetheart spoke edy boardman is cissy your sweetheart nao tearful tommy said is edy boardman your sweetheart cissy queried nao tommy said i know edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes i know who is tommy's sweetheart gerty is tommy's sweetheart nao tommy said on the verge of tears cissy's quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn't see and to mind he didn't wet his new tan shoes but who was gerty gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions lost in thought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said she was more a giltrap than a macdowell her figure was slight and graceful inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welch's female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine cupid's bow greekly perfect her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either bertha supple told that once to edy boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she'd never speak to her again no honour where honour is due there was an innate refinement a languid queenly hauteur about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaning that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charm few could resist why have women such eyes of witchery gerty's were of the bluest irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive it was madame vera verity directress of the woman beautiful page of the princess novelette who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders of fashion and she had never regretted it then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose that would suit mrs dignam because she had a button one but gerty's crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair it was dark brown with a natural wave in it she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too thursday for wealth and just now at edy's words as a telltale flush delicate as the faintest rosebloom crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety god's fair land of ireland did not hold her equal for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes she was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue inclination prompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent the pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young may morning she knew right well no one better what made squinty edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers quarrel as per usual somebody's nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother w e wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in trinity college university little recked he perhaps for what she felt that dull aching void in her heart sometimes piercing to the core yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time they were protestants in his family and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then saint joseph but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn't go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes because it was expected in the lady's pictorial that electric blue would be worn with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection she wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone all tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at clery's summer sales the very it slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny she did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew her shoes were the newest thing in footwear edy boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell a five and never would ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops as for undies they were gerty's chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though gerty would never see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery three garments and nighties extra and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons rosepink pale blue mauve and peagreen and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn't trust those washerwomen as far as she'd see them scorching the things she was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn't of a friday and yet and yet that strained look on her face a gnawing sorrow is there all the time her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where giving way to tears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror you are lovely gerty it said the paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful gerty macdowell yearns in vain yes she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy wylie t c d because the one who married the elder brother would be mrs wylie and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be he was too young to understand he would not believe in love a woman's birthright the night of the party long ago in stoer's he was still in short trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips he called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss the first but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments impetuous fellow strength of character had never been reggy wylie's strong point and he who would woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men but waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey and who would understand take her in his sheltering arms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss it would be like heaven for such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve with all the heart of her she longs to be his only his affianced bride for riches for poor in sickness in health till death us two part from this to this day forward and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face bertha supple too and edy little spitfire because she would be twentytwo in november she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen ann's pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn't like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn't eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa giltrap's lovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in clery's summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses he would be tall with broad shoulders she had always admired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon three wonderful weeks and then when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning they would both have brekky simple but perfectly served for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there'd be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if you please the temper of him o he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of pinnies edy told him no no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him you're not my sister naughty tommy said it's my ball but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career having won the day anything for a quiet life laughed ciss and she tickled tiny tot's two cheeks to make him forget and played here's the lord mayor here's his two horses here's his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him i'd like to give him something she said so i would where i won't say on the beeoteetom laughed cissy merrily gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her life to say flushing a deep rosy red and edy boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said but not a pin cared ciss let him she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose give it to him too on the same place as quick as i'd look at him madcap ciss with her golliwog curls you had to laugh at her sometimes for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men's faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white that was just like cissycums o and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down tritonville road smoking a cigarette there was none to come up to her for fun but she was sincerity itself one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of your twofaced things too sweet to be wholesome and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ it was the men's temperance retreat conducted by the missioner the reverend john hughes s j rosary sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament they were there gathered together without distinction of social class and a most edifying spectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the waves after the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet of the immaculate reciting the litany of our lady of loreto beseeching her to intercede for them the old familiar words holy mary holy virgin of virgins how sad to poor gerty's ears had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in pearson's weekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket thinking but that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days nay she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father a prey to the fumes of intoxication forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful virgin most merciful and gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk you never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face it was a palpable case of doctor fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose poor father with all his faults she loved him still when he sang tell me mary how to woo thee or my love and cottage near rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenby's salad dressing for supper and when he sang the moon hath raised with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried god have mercy on him from a stroke her mother's birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken no one would have thought the end was so near now he was laid to rest and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn't even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about catesby's cork lino artistic standard designs fit for a palace gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she didn't like her mother's taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about taking snuff everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime mr tunney the grocer's christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window you could see there was a story behind it the colours were done something lovely she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat she often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in walker's pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant the twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gerty's skirt near the little pool by the rock the twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn't come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed if you fail try again edy boardman said gerty smiled assent and bit her lip a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking she felt the warm flush a danger signal always with gerty macdowell surging and flaming into her cheeks till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray for us vessel of singular devotion pray for us mystical rose and careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary the most pious virgin's intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah and my word didn't the little chap enjoy that and then she told him to say papa say papa baby say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health a perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to be something great they said haja ja ja haja cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out holy saint denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks it was all no use soothering him with no nono baby no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss always readywitted gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little brats of twins she gazed out towards the distant sea it was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft and while she gazed her heart went pitapat yes it was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his look his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through read her very soul wonderful eyes they were superbly expressive but could you trust them people were so queer she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo she had of martin harvey the matinee idol only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn't stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retroussé from where he was sitting he was in deep mourning she could see that and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face she would have given worlds to know what it was he was looking up so intently so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down she was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was far away here was that of which she had so often dreamed it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no one else the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him her dreamhusband because she knew on the instant it was him if he had suffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had been himself a sinner a wicked man she cared not even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm she was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known those cyclists showing off what they hadn't got and she just yearned to know all to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forget the memory of the past then mayhap he would embrace her gently like a real man crushing her soft body to him and love her his ownest girlie for herself alone refuge of sinners comfortress of the afflicted ora pro nobis well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart gerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glass windows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgin's sodality and father conroy was helping canon o'hanlon at the altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of saint dominic he told her that time when she told him about that in confession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature's laws he said in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god he said and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it little monkeys common as ditchwater someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both of them and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned jacky tommy not they what a great notion they had so cissy said it was the very last time she'd ever bring them out she jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn't get it to grow long because it wasn't natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn't rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble tableau that would have been a very charming expose for a gentleman like that to witness queen of angels queen of patriarchs queen of prophets of all saints they prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed the thurible to canon o'hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn't because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon o'hanlon handed the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the tantumer gosa cramen tum three and eleven she paid for those stockings in sparrow's of george's street on the tuesday no the monday before easter and there wasn't a brack on them and that was what he was looking at transparent and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form the cheek of her because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl's shoulders a radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening in its sweetness you would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey her woman's instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty half smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse the baby irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers and she said to gerty a penny for your thoughts what replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth i was only wondering was it late because she wished to goodness they'd take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy as glib as you like said it was half past kissing time time to kiss again but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early wait said cissy i'll run ask my uncle peter over there what's the time by his conundrum so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with his watchchain looking up at the church passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself one moment he had been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order then they sang the second verse of the tantum ergo and canon o'hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour literally worshipping at her shrine if ever there was undisguised admiration in a man's passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man's face it is for you gertrude macdowell and you know it edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o'hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out panem de coelo praestitisti eis and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over gerty winced sharply a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable it hurt o yes it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was gerty's lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat so slim so flawless so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of she had loved him better than he knew lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see o responded gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud head flashed up i can throw my cap at who i like because it's leap year her words rang out crystalclear more musical than the cooing of the ringdove but they cut the silence icily there was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot miss puny little edy's countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it the little kinnatt because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof apart in another sphere that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for master boardman junior and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleeful eyes and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib o my puddeny pie protested ciss he has his bib destroyed the slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because canon o'hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse of erin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk hither thither with a tiny lost cry and she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book the lamplighter by miss cummins author of mabel vaughan and other tales for gerty had her dreams that no one knew of she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which though it did not err on the side of luxury was scrupulously neat and clean it was there she kept her girlish treasure trove the tortoiseshell combs her child of mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in hely's of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs art thou real my ideal it was called by louis j walsh magherafelt and after there was something about twilight wilt thou ever and ofttimes the beauty of poetry so sad in its transient loveliness had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her one by one and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it but it must end she felt if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her love laughs at locksmiths she would make the great sacrifice her every effort would be to share his thoughts dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse cruel only to be kind but even if what then would it make a very great difference from everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled she loathed that sort of person the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl's honour degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station no no not that they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall she thought she understood she would try to understand him because men were so different the old love was waiting waiting with little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes heart of mine she would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide nothing else mattered come what might she would be wild untrammelled free canon o'hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang laudate dominum omnes gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked wasn't she coming but jacky caffrey called out o look cissy and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church blue and then green and purple it's fireworks cissy caffrey said and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church helterskelter edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldn't fall running come on gerty cissy called it's the bazaar fireworks but gerty was adamant she had no intention of being at their beck and call if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was the eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling she looked at him a moment meeting his glance and a light broke in upon her whitehot passion was in that face passion silent as the grave and it had made her his at last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death steadfast a sterling man a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips his hands and face were working and a tremour went over her she leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that supply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passion of men like that hotblooded because bertha supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she'd never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the congested districts board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips besides there was absolution so long as you didn't do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too my dear and winny rippingham so mad about actors photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did and jacky caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air a soft thing to and fro dark and she saw a long roman candle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hush they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it high high almost out of sight and her face was suffused with a divine an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too nainsook knickers the fabric that caresses the skin better than those other pettiwidth the green four and eleven on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn't ashamed and he wasn't either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn't resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking looking she would fain have cried to him chokingly held out her snowy slender arms to him to come to feel his lips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girl's love a little strangled cry wrung from her that cry that has rung through the ages and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o and everyone cried o o in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden o so lovely o soft sweet soft then all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent ah she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly a pathetic little glance of piteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl he was leaning back against the rock behind leopold bloom for it is he stands silent with bowed head before those young guileless eyes what a brute he had been at it again a fair unsullied soul had called to him and wretch that he was how had he answered an utter cad he had been he of all men but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered should a girl tell no a thousand times no that was their secret only theirs alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don't tell cissy caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was and then she cried gerty gerty we're going come on we can see from farther up gerty had an idea one of love's little ruses she slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back wonder if he's too far to she rose was it goodbye no she had to go but they would meet again there and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her dream of yester eve she drew herself up to her full height their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of a strange shining hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face she half smiled at him wanly a sweet forgiving smile a smile that verged on tears and then they parted slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey to little baby boardman it was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because because gerty macdowell was tight boots no she's lame o mr bloom watched her as she limped away poor girl that's why she's left on the shelf and the others did a sprint thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib jilted beauty a defect is ten times worse in a woman but makes them polite glad i didn't know it

was all things combined excitement when she leaned back felt an ache at the butt of my tongue your head it simply swirls he's right might have made a worse fool of myself however instead of talking

who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind's ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipotent nature's incorrupted benefaction for who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature's boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for

stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other therefore everyman look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother's womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed the nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be she said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman's birth then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house the man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless and whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat and there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon and the traveller leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile thanked be almighty god this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time hied fast sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel said he that it be not come or now meseems it dureth overlong and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently but said he or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long and the franklin that had drunken said expecting each moment to be her next also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and now drink said he fully delectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their both's health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup woman's woe with wonder pondering now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might there was a sort of scholars along either side the board that is to wit dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciable's with other his fellows lynch and madden scholars of medicine and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa one crotthers and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested and of all them reserved young stephen he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sir leopold but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his

witty scholars and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne's house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case and they said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy a redress god grant this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay by our virgin mother the wife should live and the babe to die in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved to whom young stephen had these words following murmur sirs is eke oft among lay folk both babe and parent now glorify their maker the one in limbo gloom the other in purgefire but gramercy what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise which is the sin against the holy ghost very god lord and giver of

drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachi's praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom of law of canons of lilith patron of abortions of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or as virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with effectu secuto or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for god's greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman's seal even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he said dissembling as his wont was that as it was informed him who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions that is truth pardy said dixon and or i err a pregnant word which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady

his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb's wool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend's son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all accounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for the intentions of

crouched in horne's hall he drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden being godly certain whiles knocked

heard the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead look you having taken place and all of the order of a natural phenomenon but was young boasthard's fear vanquished by calmer's words no for he had in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be done away and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or what calmer said a hubbub of phenomenon heard why he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding which he had not done for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law then wotted he nought of that other land which is called

said is bird in the hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as ho you pretty man turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named two in the bush or by some learned carnal concupiscence this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore bird in the hand which was within all foul plagues monsters and a wicked devil they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her for regarding believe on me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for first two in the bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them pickaback and topsyturvy and shameface and cheek by jowl and second for that foul plague allpox and the monsters

charm of the same gist out of the hindustanish for his farmer's gazette to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it but on stephen's persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat to tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps ostlers bookies paul's men runners flatcaps waistcoateers ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip he took his ordinary at a boilingcook's and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother's son of them would burst their

can go hang says he with a wink for me with their bully beef a pox on it there's as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset mort aux vaches says frank then in the french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too from a child this frank had been a donought that his father a headborough who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes one time he would be a playactor then a sutler or a welsher then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids linen or choking chicken behind a hedge he had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him what says mr leopold with his hands across that was earnest to know the drift of it will they slaughter all i protest i saw them but this day morning going to the liverpool boats says he i can scarce believe tis so bad says he and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers greasy hoggets and wether wool having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin low's yard in prussia street i question with you there says he more like tis the hoose or the timber tongue mr stephen a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality that was sending over doctor rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns come come says mr vincent plain dealing he'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that's irish says he irish by name and irish by nature says mr stephen and he sent the ale purling about an irish bull in an english chinashop i conceive you says mr dixon it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emerald ring in his nose true for you says mr vincent cross the table and a bullseye into the bargain says he and a plumper and a portlier bull says he never shit on shamrock he had horns galore a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpins followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains what for that says mr dixon but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself so be off now says he and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly but the slap and the blessing stood him friend says mr vincent for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid wife abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland another then put in his word and they dressed him says he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart's content by this time the father of the faithful for so they called him was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls language and they all after him ay says another and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice saying by the lord harry green is the grass that grows on the ground and says mr dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he'd run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harry's orders there was bad blood between them at first says mr vincent and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and i'll meddle in his matters says he i'll make that animal smell hell says he with the help of that good pizzle my father left me but one evening says mr dixon when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the romans bos bovum which is good bog latin for boss of the show after that says mr vincent the lord harry put his head into a cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name then with the water running off him he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat in short he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt they were says mr stephen and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as the ungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect manned the yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the wind put her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ran up the jolly roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america which was the occasion says mr vincent of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty pope peter's but a pissabed a man's a man for a that our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered a young gentleman his name alec bannon who had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnell's bearing a legend printed in fair italics mr malachi mulligan fertiliser and incubator lambay island his project as he went on to expound was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed well let us hear of it good my friend said mr dixon i make no doubt it smacks of wenching come be seated both tis as cheap sitting as standing mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and expatiating upon his design told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility both the inhibitory and the prohibitory whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired it grieved him plaguily he said to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to the vilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weep to curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder lord talbot de malahide a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural money was no object he said nor would he take a penny for his pains the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions would find in him their man for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it they both it seems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water as might be observed by mr mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of mary's excepted to it asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which as it dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi o quirites ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque

of the forest glade the farmyard drake and duck valuing himself not a little upon his elegance being indeed a proper man of person this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced the young gentleman his friend overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour mr mulligan now perceiving the table asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and seeing the stranger he made him a civil bow and said pray sir was you in need of any professional assistance we could give who upon his offer thanked him very heartily though preserving his proper distance and replied that he was come there about a lady now an inmate of horne's house that was in an interesting condition poor body from woman's woe and here he fetched a deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet taken place mr dixon to turn the table took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence upon which he rallied him betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due as with the noted physician mr austin meldon to a wolf in the stomach for answer mr mulligan in a gale of laughter at his smalls smote himself bravely below the diaphragm exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan the most excellent creature of her sex though tis pity she's a trollop there's a belly that never bore a bastard this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber here the listener who was none other than the scotch student a little fume of a fellow blond as tow congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and interrupting the narrative at a salient point having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it mais bien sûr noble stranger said he cheerily et mille compliments that you may and very opportunely there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity but gracious heaven was i left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well my god i would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good things with these words he approached the goblet to his lips took a complacent draught of the cordial slicked his hair and opening his bosom out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness ah monsieur he said had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily in such an artless disorder of so melting a tenderness pon my conscience even you monsieur had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever i declare i was never so touched in all my life god i thank thee as the author of my days thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and having replaced the locket in his bosom he wiped his eye and sighed again beneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures how great and universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond the simple swain and the polished coxcomb the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years but indeed sir i wander from the point how mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys maledicity he exclaimed in anguish would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along i could weep to think of it then though it had poured seven showers we were neither of us a penny the worse but beshrew me he cried clapping hand to his forehead tomorrow will be a new day and thousand thunders i know of a marchand de capotes monsieur poyntz from whom i can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting tut tut cries le fecondateur tripping in my friend monsieur moore that most accomplished traveller i have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in a circle of the best wits of the town is my authority that in cape horn ventre biche they have a rain that will wet through any even the stoutest cloak a drenching of that violence he tells me sans blague has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world pooh a livre cries monsieur lynch the clumsy things are dear at a sou one umbrella were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom is worth ten such stopgaps no woman of any wit would wear one my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for as she reminded me blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies dame nature by the divine blessing has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that il y a deux choses for which the innocence of our original garb in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties is the fittest nay the only garment the first said she and here my pretty philosopher as i handed her to her tilbury to fix my attention gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear the first is a bath but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and while all were conjecturing what might be the cause miss callan entered and having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon retired with a profound bow to the company the presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry strike me silly said costello a low fellow who was fuddled a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh i'll be sworn she has rendezvoused you what you dog have you a way with them gad's bud immensely so said mr lynch the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater hospice demme does not doctor o'gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months lawksamercy doctor cried the young blood in the primrose vest feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body how you do tease a body drat the man bless me i'm all of a wibbly wobbly why you're as bad as dear little father cantekissem that you are may this pot of four half choke me cried costello if she aint in the family way i knows a lady what's got a white swelling quick as i claps eyes on her the young surgeon however rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy i want patience said he with those who without wit to enliven or learning to instruct revile an ennobling profession which saving the reverence due to the deity is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth i am positive when i say that if need were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which so far from being a byword should be a glorious incentive in the human breast i cannot away with them what malign such an one the amiable miss callan who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay perish the thought i shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of horne having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door a murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation for he swore a round hand that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath stap my vitals said he them was always the sentiments of honest frank costello which i was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart to revert to mr bloom who after his first entry had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity the young sparks it is true were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice their testiness and outrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf but the word of mr costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world which the dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin it was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and by intercepting them with the readiest precaution foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable to those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy a habit of mind which he never did hold with to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding while for such that having lost all forbearance can lose no more there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe is ever as the chaste fancy of the holy writer expresses it for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions to conclude while from the sister's words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was however it must be owned not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the supreme being accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour saying that to express his notion of the thing his opinion who ought not perchance to express one was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers the dressy young blade said it was her husband's that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another ephesian matron i must acquaint you said mr crotthers clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis old glory allelujurum was round again today an elderly man with dundrearies preferring through his nose a request to have word of wilhelmina my life as he calls her i bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon slife i'll be round with you i cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her all fell to praising of it each after his own fashion though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap a clerk in orders a linkboy virtuous or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household singular communed the guest with himself the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest but he further added it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for i have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together but with what fitness let it be asked of the noble lord his patron has this alien whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled during the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is if report belie him not his own and his only enjoyer far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady the daughter of a gallant major or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done then be it so unhappy woman she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate he says this a censor of morals a very pelican in his piety who did not scruple oblivious of the ties of nature to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society nay had the hussy's scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel it had gone with her as hard as with hagar the egyptian in the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in mr cuffe's hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic it ill becomes him to preach that gospel has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare a habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life if he must dispense his balm of gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him his marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce the lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which when rooted in its native orient throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but transplanted to a clime more temperate its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant acid and inoperative the news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the sublime porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born when he had betaken himself to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier broke out at once into a strife of tongues in vain the voice of mr canvasser bloom was heard endeavouring to urge to mollify to refrain the moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers the caesarean section posthumity with respect to the

masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations the gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest by her movement the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning ardently and ineffectually entertained to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation the abnormalities of harelip breastmole supernumerary digits

between women and the males of brutes his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the minotaur which the genius of the elegant latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his metamorphoses the impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived it was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from mr candidate mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man contemporaneously a heated argument having arisen between mr delegate madden and mr candidate lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one siamese twin predeceasing the other the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to mr canvasser

reminding stephen of years before when they had been at school together in conmee's time he asked about glaucon alcibiades pisistratus where were they now neither knew you have spoken of the past and its phantoms stephen said why think of them if i call them into life across the waters of lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call who supposes it i bous stephanoumenos bullockbefriending bard am lord and giver of their life he encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves smiling at vincent that answer and those leaves vincent said to him will adorn you more fitly when something more and greatly more than a capful of light odes can call your genius father all who wish you well hope this for you all desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate to acclaim you stephaneforos i heartily wish you may not fail them o no vincent lenehan said laying a hand on the shoulder near him have no fear he could not leave his mother an orphan the young man's face grew dark all could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss he would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart madden had lost five drachmas on sceptre for a whim of the rider's name lenehan as much more he told them of the race the flag fell and huuh off scamper the mare ran out freshly with 0 madden up she was leading the field

lalage were scarce fair beside her in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin i do not know the right name of it the chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us in the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with corinth fruit in them that periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge but she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which i held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when i pressed too close a week ago she lay ill four days on the couch but today she was free blithe mocked at peril she is more taking then her posies tool mad romp that she is she had pulled her fill as we reclined together and in your ear my friend you will not think who met us as we left the field conmee himself he was walking by the hedge reading i think a brevier book with i doubt not a witty letter in it from glycera or chloe to keep the page the sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries but he had been kind in going by he had blessed us the gods too are ever kind lenehan said if i had poor luck with bass's mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely he was laying his hand upon a winejar malachi saw it and withheld his act pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label warily malachi whispered preserve a druid silence his soul is far away it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born any object intensely regarded may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods do you not think it stephen theosophos told me so stephen answered whom in a previous existence egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law the lords of the moon theosophos told me an orangefiery shipload from planet alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation however as a matter of fact though the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character was not the case at all the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled by messrs bass and co at burton on trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark on account of its scarlet appearance he was simply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings after the moment before's observations about boyhood days and the turf recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn eventually however both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same time however a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life neither place nor council was lacking in dignity the debaters were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital the high hall of horne's house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic a gallant scene in truth it made crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of galloway there too opposite to him was lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom next the scotchman was the place assigned to costello the eccentric while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of madden the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in explorer's kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of malachi roland st john mulligan lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator fresh from the hippodrome and that vigilant wanderer soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which mr s dedalus div scep contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods science it cannot be too often repeated deals with tangible phenomena the man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can there may be it is true some questions which science cannot answer at present such as the first problem submitted by mr l bloom pubb canv regarding the future determination of sex must we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary the postmenstrual period assert others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it as most embryologists incline to opine such as culpepper spallanzani blumenbach lusk hertwig leopold and valenti a mixture of both this would be tantamount to a cooperation one of nature's favourite devices between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position succubitus felix of the passive element the other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital infant mortality it is interesting because as he pertinently remarks we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways mr m mulligan hyg et eug doc blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged

ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner mr j crotthers disc bacc attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect private or official culminating in the exposure of newborn infants the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide although the former we are thinking of neglect is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr v lynch bacc arith that both natality and mortality as

morbous germs have taken up their residence modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development an arrangement which though productive of pain to some of our feelings notably the maternal is nevertheless some of us think in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest mr s dedalus div scep remark or should it be called an interruption that an omnivorous being which can masticate deglute digest and apparently pass through the

and raises his whip encouragingly the car and horse back slowly awkwardly and turn corny kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at bloom's plight the jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply with thumb and palm corny kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done with a slow nod bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what stephen needs the car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane corny kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand bloom with his hand assuralooms corny kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay the tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay bloom holding in his hand stephen's hat festooned with shavings and ashplant stands irresolute then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder bloom eh ho there is no answer he bends again mr dedalus there is no answer the name if you call somnambulist he bends again and hesitating brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form stephen there is no answer he calls again stephen stephen groans who black panther vampire he sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels who drive fergus now and pierce wood's woven shade he turns on his left side sighing doubling himself together bloom poetry well educated pity he bends again and undoes the buttons of stephen's waistcoat to breathe he brushes the woodshavings from stephen's clothes with light hand and fingers one pound seven not hurt anyhow he listens what stephen murmurs shadows the woods white breast dim sea he stretches out his arms sighs again and curls his body bloom holding the hat and ashplant stands erect a dog barks in the distance bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant he looks down on stephen's face and form bloom communes with the night face reminds me of his poor mother in the shady wood the deep white breast ferguson i think i caught a girl some girl best thing could happen him he murmurs swear that i will always hail ever conceal never reveal any part or parts art or arts he murmurs in the rough sands of the sea a cabletow's length from the shore where the tide ebbs and flows silent thoughtful alert he stands on guard his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master against the dark wall a figure appears slowly a fairy boy of eleven a changeling kidnapped dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet holding a book in his hand he reads from right to left inaudibly smiling kissing the page bloom wonderstruck calls inaudibly rudy rudy gazes unseeing into bloom's eyes and goes on reading kissing smiling he has a delicate mauve face on his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons in his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot a white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket iii preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed his stephen's mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting off the reel the propriety of the cabman's shelter as it was called hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral but how to get there was the rub for the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition both of them being e d ed particularly stephen always assuming that there was such a thing to be found accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they both walked together along beaver street or more properly lane as far as the farrier's and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergin's but as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree outside the north star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom who was anything but a professional whistler endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twice this was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on it evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did so bevelling around by mullett's and the signal house which they shortly reached they proceeded perforce in the direction of amiens street railway terminus mr bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to vary the timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing he heroically made light of the mischance so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as it happened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey as it so happened a dublin united tramways company's sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station the starting point for belfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality not to say gruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street famous for its c division police station between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen associated with baird's the stonecutter's in his mind somehow in talbot place first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his fidus achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourke's city bakery situated quite close to where they were the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable bread the staff of life earn your bread o tell me where is fancy bread at rourke's the baker's it is said en route to his taciturn and not to put too fine a point on it not yet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties never more so in fact disgustingly sober spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swell mobsmen which barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn't look out highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr tobias or he being the solicitor rather old wall he meant to say or mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordially disliked were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and as mr bloom put it recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything you frittered away your time he very sensibly maintained and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of l s d into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question of stimulants he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of stephen by all his pubhunting confreres but one a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs and that one was judas stephen said who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's gumley to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge someone saluted you mr bloom said a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again calling night stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least though unusual in the dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper famished loiterers of the thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment's notice your money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged and garrotted stephen that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corley's breath redolent of rotten cornjuice lord john corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division lately deceased who had married a certain katherine brophy the daughter of a louth farmer his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine also talbot rumour had it though not proved that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative a woman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen this therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as lord john corley taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings his friends had all deserted him furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on god's earth he could get something anything at all to do no it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn't a complete fabrication from start to finish anyhow he was all in i wouldn't ask you only pursued he on my solemn oath and god knows i'm on the rocks there'll be a job tomorrow or next day stephen told him in a boys school at dalkey for a gentleman usher mr garrett deasy try it you may mention my name ah god corley replied sure i couldn't teach in a school man i was never one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh i got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers i have no place to sleep myself stephen informed him corley at the first go off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street there was a dosshouse in marlborough street mrs maloney's but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but m'conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in winetavern street which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon for a bob he was starving too though he hadn't said a word about it though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corley's brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence however haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corley's head that he was living in affluence and hadn't a thing to do but hand out the needful whereas he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for to his chagrin he found his cash missing a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation he tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact he was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect about biscuits he dimly remembered who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy however in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies erroneously however as it turned out those are halfcrowns man corley corrected him and so in point of fact they turned out to be stephen anyhow lent him one of them thanks corley answered you're a gentleman i'll pay you back one time who's that with you i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan the billsticker you might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there i'd carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks man god you've to book ahead man you'd think it was for the carl rosa i don't give a shite anyway so long as i get a job even as a crossing sweeper subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky that he said stephen knew well out of fullam's the shipchandler's bookkeeper there that used to be often round in nagle's back with o'mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable 210 mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman's sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work it struck him was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while dublin slept he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephen's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to put it a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very rara avis altogether in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning pretty thick that was certainly the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who with his practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite alluding to the encounter he said laughingly stephen that is he is down on his luck he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named boylan a billsticker to give him a job as a sandwichman at this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest mr bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair whereupon he observed evasively everybody gets their own ration of luck they say now you mention it his face was familiar to me but leaving that for the moment how much did you part with he queried if i am not too inquisitive half a crown stephen responded i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere needs mr bloom ejaculated professing not the least surprise at the intelligence i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he invariably does everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds but talking about things in general where added he with a smile will you sleep yourself walking to sandycove is out of the question and even supposing you did you won't get in after what occurred at westland row station simply fag out there for nothing i don't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father's house to seek misfortune was stephen's answer i met your respected father on a recent occasion mr bloom diplomatically returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate on yesterday where does he live at present i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved i believe he is in dublin somewhere stephen answered unconcernedly why a gifted man mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one he takes great pride quite legitimate out of you you could go back perhaps he hasarded still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two mulligan that is and that english tourist friend of his who eventually euchred their third companion were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion which they did there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however such as it was stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by the ingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy boody and katey the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it being quarter tense or if not ember days or something like that no mr bloom repeated again i wouldn't personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element dr mulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals of course you didn't notice as much as i did but it wouldn't occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a versatile allround man by no means confined to medicine only who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was verified bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at skerries or malahide was it was he was bound to admit an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy pure and simple except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains he ventured to throw out the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at stephen's at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that high educational abilities though he possessed he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet adjacent to the men's public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way there being some little differences between the parties puttana madonna che ci dia i quattrini ho ragione culo rotto intendiamoci mezzo sovrano piu dice lui pero mezzo farabutto mortacci sui ma ascolta cinque la testa piu mr bloom and stephen entered the cabman's shelter an unpretentious wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if ever been before the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skin the goat fitzharris the invincible though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in a few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity now touching a cup of coffee mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food say a roll of some description accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly the hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied away though one redbearded bibulous individual portion of whose hair was greyish a sailor probably still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor mr bloom availing himself of the right of free speech he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though to be sure rather in a quandary over voglio remarked to his protégé in an audible tone of voice a propos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious a beautiful language i mean for singing purposes why do you not write your poetry in that language bella poetria it is so melodious and full belladonna voglio stephen who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could suffering from lassitude generally replied to fill the ear of a cow elephant they were haggling over money is that so mr bloom asked of course he subjoined pensively at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tête â tête put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun or so it seemed after which he beat a retreat to his counter mr bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to for which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him sounds are impostures stephen said after a pause of some little time like names cicero podmore napoleon mr goodbody jesus mr doyle shakespeares were as common as murphies what's in a name yes to be sure mr bloom unaffectedly concurred of course our name was changed too he added pushing the socalled roll across the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded stephen whom he had singled out for attention in particular squarely by asking and what might your name be just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companion's boot but stephen apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter answered dedalus the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes rather bunged up from excessive use of boose preferably good old hollands and water you know simon dedalus he asked at length i've heard of him stephen said mr bloom was all at sea for a moment seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too he's irish the seaman bold affirmed staring still in much the same way and nodding all irish all too irish stephen rejoined as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder the lefthand dead shot though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain bottles out there say fifty yards measured eggs on the bottles cocks his gun over his shoulder aims he turned his body half round shut up his right eye completely then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance pom he then shouted once the entire audience waited anticipating an additional detonation there being still a further egg pom he shouted twice egg two evidently demolished he nodded and winked adding bloodthirstily buffalo bill shoots to kill never missed nor he never will a silence ensued till mr bloom for agreeableness sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the bisley beg pardon the sailor said long ago mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth why the sailor replied relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond it might be a matter of ten years he toured the wide world with hengler's royal circus i seen him do that in stockholm curious coincidence mr bloom confided to stephen unobtrusively murphy's my name the sailor continued d b murphy of carrigaloe know where that is queenstown harbour stephen replied that's right the sailor said fort camden and fort carlisle that's where i hails from i belongs there that's where i hails from my little woman's down there she's waiting for me i know for england home and beauty she's my own true wife i haven't seen for seven years now sailing about mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene the homecoming to the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled davy jones a rainy night with a blind moon across the world for a wife quite a number of stories there were on that particular alice ben bolt topic enoch arden and rip van winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember caoc o'leary a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor john casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way never about the runaway wife coming back however much devoted to the absentee the face at the window judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half wrecked in his affections you little expected me but i've come to stay and make a fresh start there she sits a grasswidow at the selfsame fireside believes me dead rocked in the cradle

arrival is on her knee post mortem child with a high ro and a randy ro and my galloping tearing tandy o bow to the inevitable grin and bear it i remain with much love your brokenhearted husband d b murphy the sailor who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident turned to one of the jarvies with the request you don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand thank you the sailor said he deposited the quid in his gob and chewing and with some slow stammers proceeded we come up this morning eleven o'clock the threemaster rosevean from bridgwater with bricks i shipped to get over paid off this afternoon there's my discharge see d b murphy a b s in confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document you must have seen a fair share of the world the keeper remarked leaning on the counter why the sailor answered upon reflection upon it i've circumnavigated a bit since i first joined on i was in the red sea i was in china and north america and south america we was chased by pirates one voyage i seen icebergs plenty growlers i was in stockholm and the black sea the dardanelles under captain dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship i seen russia gospodi pomilyou that's how the russians prays you seen queer sights don't be talking put in a jarvey why the sailor said shifting his partially chewed plug i seen queer things too ups and downs i seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as i chew that quid he took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and lodging it between his teeth bit ferociously khaan like that and i seen maneaters in peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses look here here they are a friend of mine sent me he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table the printed matter on it stated choza de indios beni bolivia all focussed their attention at the scene exhibited a group of savage women in striped loincloths squatted blinking suckling frowning sleeping amid a swarm of infants there must have been quite a score of them outside some primitive shanties of osier chews coca

raw his postcard proved a centre of attraction for messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more know how to keep them off he inquired generally nobody volunteering a statement he winked saying glass that boggles em glass mr bloom without evincing surprise unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark it ran as follows tarjeta postal señor a boudin galeria becche santiago chile there was no message evidently as he took particular notice though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite william tell and the lazarillo don cesar de bazan incident depicted in maritana on which occasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat having detected a discrepancy between his name assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q t somewhere and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend's bona fides nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some wednesday or saturday of travelling to london via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to holyhead which was his longest martin cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through but even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking boyd's heart it was not so dear purse permitting a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and back the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable especially for a chap whose liver was out of order seeing the different places along the route plymouth falmouth southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis the spectacle of our modern babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower abbey wealth of park lane to renew acquaintance with another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas eastbourne scarborough margate and so on beautiful bournemouth the channel islands and similar bijou spots which might prove highly remunerative not of course with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job witness mrs c p m'coy type lend me your valise and i'll post you the ticket no something top notch an all star irish caste the tweedy flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the elster grimes and moody manners perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure but who that was the rub also without being actually positive it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the fishguard rosslare route which it was mooted was once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally a great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large the average man i e brown robinson and co it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street when the system really needed toning up for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick in the mud took me for a wife after all hang it they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life there were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around dublin and its picturesque environs even poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram but also farther away from the madding crowd in wicklow rightly termed the garden of ireland an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn't come down and in the wilds of donegal where if report spoke true the coup d'oeil was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while howth with its historic associations and otherwise silken thomas grace o'malley george iv rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men's fancy though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally usually by the way on their left leg it being only about three quarters of an hour's run from the pillar because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy so to speak and the accommodation left much to be desired interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity pure and simple was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact he turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to stephen i seen a chinese one time related the doughty narrator that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different one was a ship another was a house another was a flower cooks rats in your soup he appetisingly added the chinks does possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on adhering to his adventures and i seen a man killed in trieste by an italian chap knife in his back knife like that whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position in a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers fellow hid behind a door come up behind him like that prepare to meet your god says he chuk it went into his back up to the butt his heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to that's a good bit of steel repeated he examining his formidable stiletto after which harrowing denouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors otherwise pocket they're great for the cold steel somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all that was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives at this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss mr b and stephen each in his own particular way both instinctively exchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however towards where skin the goat alias the keeper not turning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair his inscrutable face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itself beggaring description conveyed the impression that he didn't understand one jot of what was going on funny very there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with the natives choza de another the seaman's discharge mr bloom so far as he was personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood he vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm figuratively speaking early in the eighties eightyone to be correct when he was just turned fifteen ay boss the sailor broke in give us back them papers the request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape have you seen the rock of gibraltar mr bloom inquired the sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ay or no ah you've touched there too mr bloom said europa point thinking he had in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn what year would that be about mr b interrogated can you recall the boats our soi disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering i'm tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships salt junk all the time tired seemingly he ceased his questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe suffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves on more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidently derelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall staring quite obliviously at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings and it left him wondering why possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under well not exactly under tempting the fates and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all nevertheless without going into the minutiae of the business the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large no matter where living inland or seaside as the case might be having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called ireland expects that every man and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights kish and others liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy not to say stormy weather there was a fellow sailed with me in the rover the old seadog himself a rover proceeded went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman's valet at six quid a month them are his trousers i've on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife i'm game for that job shaving and brushup i hate roaming about there's my son now danny run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper's in cork where he could be drawing easy money what age is he queried one hearer who by the way seen from the side bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell the townclerk away from the carking cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage why the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son danny he'd be about eighteen now way i figure it the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater he remarked sure as nuts i must get a wash tomorrow or next day it's them black lads i objects to i hate those buggers suck your blood dry they does seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner's hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man's sideface looking frowningly rather tattoo the exhibitor explained that was done when we were iying becalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton fellow the name of antonio done that there he is himself a greek did it hurt much doing it one asked the sailor that worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round the someway in his squeezing or see here he said showing antonio there he is cursing the mate and there he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with his fingers some special knack evidently and he laughing at a yarn and in point of fact the young man named antonio's livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including skin the goat who this time stretched over ay ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest he's gone too ate by sharks after ay ay he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before neat bit of work one longshoreman said and what's the number for loafer number two queried eaten alive a third asked the sailor ay ay sighed again the latter personage more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number ate a greek he was and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end as bad as old antonio for he left me on my ownio the face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill mr bloom scarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid aside he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay the partially idiotic female namely of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you mrs b and begged the chance of his washing also why washing which seemed rather vague than not your washing still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife's undergarments when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a man's similar garments initialled with bewley and draper's marking ink hers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me love my dirty shirt still just then being on tenterhooks he desired the female's room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off round the side of the evening telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper murphy's nautical chest and then there was no more of her the gunboat the keeper said it beats me mr bloom confided to stephen medically i am speaking how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses if he values his health in the least unfortunate creature of course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition still no matter what the cause is from stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merely remarking in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul she is a bad merchant she buys dear and sells cheap the elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil w ere not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he could truthfully state he as a paterfamilias was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start whoever embarked on a policy of the sort he said and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned you as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe in the soul or do you mean the intelligence the brainpower as such as distinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays for instance do you thus cornered stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible it would be immortal i understand but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who from all i can hear is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple promptly rejoining simple i shouldn't think that is the proper word of course i grant you to concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays rontgen did or the telescope like edison though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man i mean and the same applies to the laws for example of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it's a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god o that stephen expostulated has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in holy writ apart from circumstantial evidence on this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages clashed has been the more experienced of the two objected sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief i'm not so sure about that that's a matter for everyman's opinion and without dragging in the sectarian side of the business i beg to differ with you in toto there my belief is to tell you the candid truth that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it's the big question of our national poet over again who precisely wrote them like hamlet and bacon as you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i of course i needn't tell you can't you drink that coffee by the way let me stir it and take a piece of that bun it's like one of our skipper's bricks disguised still no one can give what he hasn't got try a bit couldn't stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance and lucrative work to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and useful lectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying the idea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profit there being no competition to speak of sulphate of copper poison so4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn't remember when it was or where anyhow inspection medical inspection of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr tibble's vi cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved have a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage still it's solid food his good genius urged i'm a stickler for solid food his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work mental or manual you ought to eat more solid food you would feel a different man liquids i can eat stephen said but o oblige me by taking away that knife i can't look at the point of it it reminds me of roman history mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it our mutual friend's stories are like himself mr bloom apropos of knives remarked to his confidante sotto voce do you think they are genuine he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots look at him yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to baldness there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as people often did about others namely that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described on the other hand he might be only bluffing a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs dublin residents like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner hesperus and etcetera and when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn't probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him mind you i'm not saying that it's all a pure invention he resumed analogous scenes are occasionally if not often met with giants though that is rather a far cry you see once in a way marcella the midget queen in those waxworks in henry street i myself saw some aztecs as they are called sitting bowlegged they couldn't straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here you see he proceeded indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up being adored as gods there's an example again of simple souls however reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures who reminded him a bit of ludwig alias ledwidge when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the management in the flying dutchman a stupendous success and his host of admirers came in large numbers everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it he conceded on the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little italy there near the coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and he added on the cheap spaniards for instance he continued passionate temperaments like that impetuous as old nick are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen it comes from the great heat climate generally my wife is so to speak spanish half that is point of fact she could actually claim spanish nationality if she wanted having been born in technically spain i e gibraltar she has the spanish type quite dark regular brunette black i for one certainly believe climate accounts for character that's why i asked you if you wrote your poetry in italian the temperaments at the door stephen interposed with were very passionate about ten shillings roberto ruba roba sua quite so mr bloom dittoed then stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere we have the impetuosity of dante and the isosceles triangle miss portinari he fell in love with and leonardo and san tommaso mastino it's in the blood mr bloom acceded at once all are washed in the blood of the sun coincidence i just happened to be in the kildare street museum 890 today shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call it and i was just looking at those antique statues there the splendid proportions of hips bosom you simply don't knock against those kind of women here an exception here and there handsome yes pretty in a way you find but what i'm talking about is the female form besides they have so little taste in dress most of them which greatly enhances a woman's natural beauty no matter what you say rumpled stockings it may be possibly is a foible of mine but still it's a thing i simply hate to see interest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog goo collisions with icebergs all that sort of thing shipahoy of course had his own say to say he had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon a kind of wind in the china seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing he declared stood to him or words to that effect a pious medal he had that saved him so then after that they drifted on to the wreck off daunt's rock wreck of that illfated norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of henry campbell remembered it palme on booterstown strand that was the talk of the town that year albert william quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of 910 distinctive merit on the topic for the irish times breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror then someone said something about the case of the s s lady cairns of swansea run into by the mona which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck no aid was given her master the mona's said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way she had no water it appears in her hold at this stage an incident happened it having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat let me cross your bows mate he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze he made tracks heavily slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and applying its nozz1e to his lips take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise the irrepressible bloom who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes could by straining just perceive him when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit gaping up at the piers and girders of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor evidently giving it a wide berth eased himself closer at hand the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank a hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who though now broken down and fast breaking up was none other in stern reality than the gumley aforesaid now practically on the parish rates given the temporary job by pat tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of morpheus a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool 100 pounds a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of and there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver he drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if a big if however he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality all meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in irish shipping coastwise and foreign as well which was all part and parcel of the same thing a palgrave murphy boat was put off the ways at alexandra basin the only launch that year right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called there were wrecks and wreckers the keeper said who was evidently au fait what he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr worthington or some name like that eh ask the then captain he advised them how much palmoil the british government gave him for that day's work captain john lever of the lever line am i right skipper he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions that worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds mr bloom's sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably which it was so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation cum potation introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soirée boisterously trolling like a veritable son of a seacook the biscuits was as hard as brass and the beef as salt as lot's wife's arse o johnny lever johnny lever o after which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided skin the goat assuming he was he evidently with an axe to grind was airing his grievances in a forcible feeble philippic anent the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of god's earth far and away superior to england with coal in large quantities six million pounds worth of pork exported every year ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact you could grow any mortal thing in irish soil he stated and there was that colonel everard down there in navan growing tobacco where would you find anywhere the like of irish bacon but a day of reckoning he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice thoroughly monopolising all the conversation was in store for mighty england despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes there would be a fall and the greatest fall in history the germans and the japs were going to have their little lookin he affirmed the boers were the beginning of the end brummagem england was toppling already and her downfall would be ireland her achilles heel which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of achilles the greek hero a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot his advice to every irishman was stay in the land of your birth and work for ireland and live for ireland ireland parnell said could not spare a single one of her sons silence all round marked the termination of his finale the impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed take a bit of doing boss retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism to which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view who's the best troops in the army the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated and the best jumpers and racers and the best admirals and generals we've got tell me that the irish for choice retorted the cabby like campbell facial blemishes apart that's right the old tarpaulin corroborated the irish catholic peasant he's the backbone of our empire you know jem mullins while allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire ours or his and considered no irishman worthy of his salt that served it then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter both needless to say appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn't indulge in recriminations and come to blows from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealed their strength than the opposite it was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies equally relevant to the issue might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart another little interesting point the amours of whores and chummies to put it in common parlance reminded him irish soldiers had as often fought for england as against her more so in fact and now why so the scene between the pair of them the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been fitzharris the famous invincible and the other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the lookeron a student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the game and as for the lessee or keeper who probably wasn't the other person at all he b couldn't help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting there always being the offchance of a dannyman coming forward and turning queen's evidence or king's now like denis or peter carey an idea he utterly repudiated quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle yet though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remaining what he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife cold steel with the courage of his political convictions though personally he would never be a party to any such thing off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south have her or swing for her when the husband frequently after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that fitz nicknamed skin the goat merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not if he was reliably informed actually party to the ambush which in point of fact was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on in any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend the pseudo skin the etcetera he had transparently outlived his welcome he ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high like actresses always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again generous to a fault of course temperamental no economising or any idea of the sort always snapping at the bone for the shadow so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some l s d in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the old ireland tavern come back to erin and so on then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender he took umbrage at something or other that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared i let slip he called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively so i without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his god i mean christ was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality i'm not that was one for him a soft answer turns away wrath he hadn't a word to say for himself as everyone saw am i not right he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn't all exactly ex quibus stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent their two or four eyes conversing christus or bloom his name is or after all any other secundum carnem of course mr b proceeded to stipulate you must look at both sides of the question it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country they say our own distressful included has the government it deserves but with a little goodwill all round it's all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality i resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form it never reaches anything or stops anything a revolution must come on the due instalments plan it's a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular in the next house so to speak memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes war stephen assented between skinner's alley and ormond market yes mr bloom thoroughly agreed entirely endorsing the remark that was overwhelmingly right and the whole world was full of that sort of thing you just took the words out of my mouth he said a hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn't remotely all those wretched quarrels in his humble opinion stirring up bad blood from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything greed and jealousy people never knowing when to stop they accuse remarked he audibly he turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to so as the others in case they jews he softly imparted in an aside in stephen's ear are accused of ruining not a vestige of truth in it i can safely say history would you be surprised to learn proves up to the hilt spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and england prospered when cromwell an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for imported them why because they are imbued with the proper spirit they are practical and are proved to be so i don't want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are but in the economic not touching religion domain the priest spells poverty spain again you saw in the war compared with goahead america turks it's in the dogma because if they didn't believe they'd go straight to heaven when they die they'd try to live better at least so i think that's the juggle on which the p p's raise the wind on false pretences i'm he resumed with dramatic force as good an irishman as that rude person i told you about at the outset and i want to see everyone concluded he all creeds and classes pro rata having a comfortable tidysized income in no niggard fashion either something in the neighbourhood of 300 pounds per annum that's the vital issue at stake and it's feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man at least that's my idea for what it's worth i call that patriotism ubi patria as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in alma mater vita bene where you can live well the sense is if you work over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee listening to this synopsis of things in general stephen stared at nothing in particular he could hear of course all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn't say the words the voice he heard said if you work count me out he managed to remark meaning work the eyes were surprised at this observation because as he the person who owned them pro tem observed or rather his voice speaking did all must work have to together i mean of course the other hastened to affirm work in the widest possible sense also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays that's work too important work after all from the little i know of you after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price you have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has what you both belong to ireland the brain and the brawn each is equally important you suspect stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh that i may be important because i belong to the faubourg saint patrice called ireland for short i would go a step farther mr bloom insinuated but i suspect stephen interrupted that ireland must be important because it belongs to me what belongs queried mr bloom bending fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension excuse me unfortunately i didn't catch the latter portion what was it you stephen patently crosstempered repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely adding 1170 we can't change the country let us change the subject at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom to change the subject looked down but in a quandary as he couldn't tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry the rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state probably the homelife to which mr b attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn't been familiarised with the right sort of people with a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from paris the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister failing to throw much light on the subject however he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves for instance there was the case of o'callaghan for one the halfcrazy faddist respectably connected though of inadequate means with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper a fact and then the usual denouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got 1190 landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends after a strong hint to a blind horse from john mallon of lower castle yard so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act certain names of those subpoenaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains briefly putting two and two together six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to antonio and so forth jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne then heir apparent the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature a thing good mrs grundy as the law stands was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it ladies who like distinctive underclothing should and every welltailored man must trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two she unbuttoned his and then he untied her mind the pin whereas savages in the cannibal islands say at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental however reverting to the original there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps sheer force of natural genius that with brains sir for which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small intellectual stimulation as such was he felt from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind added to which was the coincidence of meeting discussion dance row old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type night loafers the whole galaxy of events all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth viz coalminers divers scavengers etc were very much under the microscope lately to improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as mr philip beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove as he fully intended doing at the rate of one guinea per column my experiences let us say

forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of misprints is that first epistle to the hebrews he asked as soon as his bottom jaw would let him in text open thy mouth and put thy foot in it it is

also ran j de bremond's french horse bantam lyons was anxiously inquiring after not in yet but expected any minute maximum ii different ways of bringing off a coup lovemaking damages though that halfbaked lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though as the event turned out the poor fool hadn't much reason to congratulate himself on his pick the forlorn hope guesswork it reduced itself to eventually there was every indication they would arrive at that he bloom said who the other whose hand by the way was hurt said one morning you would open the paper the cabman affirmed and read return of parnell he bet them what they liked a dublin fusilier was in that shelter one night and said he saw him in south africa pride it was killed him he ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with no one to point a finger at him then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses dead he wasn't simply absconded somewhere the coffin they brought over was full of stones he changed his name to de wet the boer general he made a mistake to fight the priests and so forth and so on all the same bloom properly so dubbed was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and even supposing he thought a return highly inadvisable all things considered something evidently riled them in his death either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the alice where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as fox and stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet whereas messrs so and so who though they weren't even a patch on the former man ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between it certainly pointed a moral the idol with feet of clay and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging and the identical same with murderers you had to come back that haunting sense kind of drew you to show the understudy in the title rôle how to he saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the insuppressible or was it united ireland a privilege he keenly appreciated and in point of fact handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said thank you excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip what's bred in the bone still as regards return you were a lucky dog if they didn't set the terrier at you directly you got back then a lot of shillyshally usually followed tom for and dick and harry against and then number one you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the tichborne case roger charles tichborne bella was the boat's name to the best of his recollection he the heir went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in indian ink lord bellew was it as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then when got up to tally with the description given introduce himself with excuse me my name is so and so or some such commonplace remark a more prudent course as bloom said to the not over effusive in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him would have been to sound the lie of the land first that bitch that english whore did for him the shebeen proprietor commented she put the first nail in his coffin fine lump of a woman all the same the soi disant townclerk henry campbell remarked and plenty of her she loosened many a man's thighs i seen her picture in a barber's the husband was a captain or an officer ay skin the goat amusingly added he was and a cottonball one this gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage as regards bloom he without the faintest suspicion of a smile merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts to make matters worse were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings first it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into since their names were coupled though since he was her declared favourite where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops the fact namely that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel having gained admittance in the same fashion a fact the weeklies addicted to the lubric a little simply coined shoals of money out of whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene strong to the verge of weakness falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties the usual sequel to bask in the loved one's smiles the eternal question of the life connubial needless to say cropped up can real love supposing there happens to be another chap in the case exist between married folk poser though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection carried away by a wave of folly a magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary that is who was just the usual everyday farewell my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons the 18th hussars to be accurate and inflammable doubtless the fallen leader that is not the other in his own peculiar way which she of course woman quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole his erstwhile staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass's kick looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream and then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times why as he reflected irishtown strand a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since as it happened he went to reside on the north side north or south however it was just the wellknown case of hot passion pure and simple upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so types that wouldn't do things by halves passionate abandon of the south casting every shred of decency to the winds just bears out what i was saying he with glowing bosom said to stephen about blood and the sun and if i don't greatly mistake she was spanish too the king of spain's daughter stephen answered adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you spanish onions and the first land called the deadman and from ramhead to scilly was so and so many was she bloom ejaculated surprised though not astonished by any means i never heard that rumour before possible especially there it was as she lived there so spain carefully avoiding a book in his pocket sweets of which reminded him by the by of that cap l street library book out of date he took out his pocketbook and turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he do you consider by the by he said thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table that a spanish type stephen obviously addressed looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom with more than vision of breasts her full lips parted and some perfect teeth standing near ostensibly with gravity a piano on the rest of which was in old madrid a ballad pretty in its way which was then all the vogue her the lady's eyes dark large looked at stephen about to smile about something to be admired lafayette of westmoreland street dublin's premier photographic artist being responsible for the esthetic execution mrs bloom my wife the prima donna madam marion tweedy bloom indicated taken a few years since in or about ninety six very like her then beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his 1440 legal wife who he intimated was the accomplished daughter of major brian tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen as for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup she could without difficulty he said have posed for the ensemble not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the he dwelt being a bit of an artist in his spare time on the female form in general developmentally because as it so happened no later than that afternoon he had seen those grecian statues 1450 perfectly developed as works of art in the national museum marble could give the original shoulders back all the symmetry all the rest yes puritanisme it does though saint joseph's sovereign thievery alors bandez figne toi trop whereas no photo could because it simply wasn't art in a word the spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack tar's good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself her stage presence being frankly a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to but it was scarcely professional etiquette so though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering for sunshine after storm and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves none the worse for wear however and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other's possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint in fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled good as new much better in fact with the starch out suppose she was gone when he i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about ruby with met him pike hoses sic in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to lindley murray the vicinity of the young man he certainly relished educated distingué and impulsive into the bargain far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn't think he had it in him yet you would besides he said the picture was handsome which say what you like it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter and why not an awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business how they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations when the thing ran its normal course became in due course intimate then the decree nisi and the king's proctor tries to show cause why and he failing to quash it nisi was made absolute but as for that the two misdemeanants wrapped up as they largely were in one another could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course he b enjoyed the distinction of being close to erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic fracas when the fallen leader's who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery leader's trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the insuppressible or no it was united ireland a by no means by the by appropriate appellative and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the o'brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune's private morals though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she however was the first to perceive as those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach fortunately not of a grave character his hat parnell's a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and as a matter of strict history bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he as a matter of fact having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else what's bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb saying thank you sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day history repeating itself with a difference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave on the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing 1530 immoderately pretending to understand everything the why and the wherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another's arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others he personally being of a sceptical bias believed and didn't make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument when neglecting her duties she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent the upshot being that her affections centred on another the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt it was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime in the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ways and flowers and chocs to think of him house and homeless rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother was really too bad at his age the queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other's senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or failing that the homely humpty dumpty boiled at what o'clock did you dine he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face some time yesterday stephen said yesterday exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow friday ah you mean it's after twelve the day before yesterday stephen said improving on himself literally astounded at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected though they didn't see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the one train of thought at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in retrospect which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas for instance when the evicted tenants question then at its first inception bulked largely in people's mind though it goes without saying not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums some of which wouldn't exactly hold water he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion a partiality however which realising his mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan's so that he though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals be it repeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows chiefly destruction of the fittest in a word anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons getting on for one as it was it was high time to be retiring for the night the crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue somebody having a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog breed unknown with a lame paw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too to ontario terrace as he very distinctly remembered having been there so to speak on the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity all things considered his initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway for one thing he mightn't what you call jump at the idea if approached and what mostly worried him was he didn't know how to lead up to it or word it exactly supposing he did entertain the proposal as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe if found suitable at all events he wound up by concluding eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent a cup of epps's cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up a move had to be made because that merry old soul the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot didn't appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger's bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character's whereabouts for a few days to come alternately racking their feelings the mermaids with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody's bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address as mr algebra remarks passim at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep the most vulnerable point too of tender achilles your god was a jew because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from carrick on shannon or somewhereabouts in the county sligo i propose our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo as it's rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over my diggings are quite close in the vicinity you can't drink that stuff do you like cocoa wait i'll just pay this lot the best plan clearly being to clear out the remainder being plain sailing he beckoned while prudently pocketing the photo to the keeper of the shanty who didn't seem to yes that's the best he assured stephen to whom for the matter of that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less all kinds of utopian plans were flashing through his b's busy brain education the genuine article literature journalism prize titbits up to date billing concert tours in english watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres turning money away duets in italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck an opening was all was wanted because he more than suspected he had his father's voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well by the way no harm to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy earl cadogan had presided at the cabdrivers association dinner in london somewhere silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir anthony macdonnell had left euston for the chief secretary's lodge or words to that effect to which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why give us a squint at that literature grandfather the ancient mariner put in manifesting some natural impatience and welcome answered the elderly party thus addressed the sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears are you bad in the eyes the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried why answered the seafarer with the tartan beard who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as i uses goggles reading sand in the red sea done that one time i could read a book in the dark manner of speaking the arabian nights entertainment was my favourite and red as a rose is she hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon lord only knows what found drowned or the exploits of king willow iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for notts during which time completely regardless of ire the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions that is to say either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark to cut a long story short bloom grasping the situation was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming making a grand total of fourpence the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers literally the last of the mohicans he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures coffee 2d confectionery do and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way as wetherup used to remark come he counselled to close the séance seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the élite society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente stephen who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out paused at the for a moment the door one thing i never understood he said to be original on the spur of the moment why they put tables upside down at night i mean chairs upside down on the tables in cafes to which impromptu the neverfailing bloom replied without a moment's hesitation saying straight off to sweep the floor in the morning so saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion's right a habit of his by the bye his right side being in classical idiom his tender achilles the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins it will the air do you good bloom said meaning also the walk in a moment the only thing is to walk then you'll feel a different man come it's not far lean on me accordingly he passed his left arm in stephen's right and led him on accordingly yes stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him sinewless and wobbly and all that anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones brazier etc where the municipal supernumerary ex gumley was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy as the adage has it dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new and apropos of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings so they turned on to chatting about music a form of art for which bloom as a pure amateur possessed the greatest love as they made tracks arm in arm across beresford place wagnerian music though confessedly grand in its way was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to follow at the first go off but the music of mercadante's huguenots meyerbeer's seven last words on the cross and mozart's twelfth mass he simply revelled in the gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those moody and sankey hymns or bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be he also yielded to none in his admiration of rossini's stabat mater a work simply abounding in immortal numbers in which his wife madam marion tweedy made a hit a veritable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other laureis and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers church in upper gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos or virtuosi rather there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore on the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the don giovanni description and martha a gem in its line he had a penchant though with only a surface knowledge for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn and talking of that taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites he mentioned par excellence lionel's air in martha m'appari which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be more accurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips of stephen's respected father sung to perfection a study of the number in fact which made all the others take a back seat stephen in reply to a politely put query said he didn't sing it but launched out into praises of shakespeare's songs at least of in or about that period the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist who anno ludendo hausi doulandus an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch whom b did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar for sixtyfive guineas and farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and byrd william who played the virginals he said in the queen's chapel or anywhere else he found them and one tomkins who made toys or airs and john bull on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse dragging a sweeper paced on the paven ground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull he inquired if it was john bull the political celebrity of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as a striking coincidence by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn which perceiving bloom who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the other's sleeve gently jocosely remarking our lives are in peril tonight beware of the steamroller they thereupon stopped bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker a hipshaker a blackbuttocker a taildangler a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts but such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn't a lump of sugar but as he wisely reflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up he was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse without a second care in the world but even a dog he reflected take that mongrel in barney kiernan's of the same size would be a holy horror to face but it was no animal's fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel ship of the desert distilling grapes into potheen in his hump nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees whale with a harpoon hairpin alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke chalk a circle for a rooster tiger my eagle eye these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from stephen's words while the ship of the street was manoeuvring and stephen went on about the highly interesting old what's this i was saying ah yes my wife he intimated plunging in medias res would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen image of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built still supposing he had his father's gift as he more than suspected it opened up new vistas in his mind such as lady fingall's irish industries concert on the preceding monday and aristocracy in general exquisite variations he was now describing on an air youth here has end by jans pieter sweelinck a dutchman of amsterdam where the frows come from even more he liked an old german song of johannes jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens sweet murderers of men which boggled bloom a bit von der sirenen listigkeit tun die poeten dichten these opening bars he sang and translated extempore bloom nodding said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that the rarest of boons which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entrée into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of b a a huge ad in its way and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he a youthful tyro in society's sartorial niceties hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the christmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of which as he happened to know were on record in fact without giving the show away he himself once upon a time if he cared to could easily have added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at going hand in hand with his tuition fees not he parenthesised that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped besides though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree original music like that different from the conventional rut would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublin's musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by ivan st austell and hilton st just and their genus omne yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city's esteem where he could command a stiff figure and booking ahead give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street house given a backerup if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs so to speak a big if however with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows and it need not detract from the other by one iota as being his own master he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone in fact he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort hung on to him at all the horse was just then and later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who he noticed was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present deprecate him or whatever you like to call it which in bloom's humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person's character no pun intended the horse having reached the end of his tether so to speak halted and rearing high a proud feathering tail added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish three smoking globes of turds slowly three times one after another from a full crupper he mired and humanely his driver waited till he or she had ended patient in his scythed car side by side bloom profiting by the contretemps with stephen passed through the gap of the chains divided by the upright and stepping over a strand of mire went across towards gardiner street lower stephen singing more boldly but not loudly the end of the ballad und alle schiffe brücken the driver never said a word good bad or indifferent but merely watched the two figures as he sat on his lowbacked car both black one full one lean walk towards the railway bridge to be married by father maher as they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their tête à tête which of course he was utterly out of about sirens enemies of man's reason mingled with a number of other topics of the same category usurpers historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn't possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car what parallel courses did bloom and stephen follow returning starting united both at normal walking pace from beresford place they followed in the order named lower and middle gardiner streets and mountjoy square west then at reduced pace each bearing left gardiner's place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of temple street then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt bearing right temple street north as far as hardwicke place approaching disparate at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before george's church diametrically the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary music literature ireland dublin paris friendship woman prostitution diet the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets the roman catholic church ecclesiastical celibacy the irish nation jesuit education careers the study of medicine the past day the maleficent influence of the presabbath stephen's collapse did bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious national social and ethical doctrines both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism were their views on some points divergent stephen dissented openly from bloom's views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while bloom dissented tacitly from stephen's views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature bloom assented covertly to stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the irish nation to christianity from druidism by patrick son of calpornus son of potitus son of odyssus sent by pope celestine i in the year 432 in the reign of leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of cormac macart died 266 a d suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at sletty and interred at rossnaree the collapse which bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud perceived by both from two different points of observation

julius juda mastiansky on both occasions in the parlour of his bloom's house in lombard street west what reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884 1885 1886 1888 1892 1893 1904 did bloom make before their arrival at their destination he reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations as in what ways from inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received existence with existence he was with any as any with any from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived what act did bloom make on their arrival at their destination at the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers number 7 eccles street he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey was it there it was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding why was he doubly irritated because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget what were then the alternatives before the premeditatedly respectively and inadvertently keyless couple to enter or not to enter to knock or not to knock bloom's decision a stratagem resting his feet on the dwarf wall he climbed over the area railings compressed his hat on his head grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall did he fall by his body's known

uninjured by concussion regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery ignited a lucifer match by friction set free inflammable coal gas by turningon the ventcock lit a high flame which by regulating he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle what discrete succession of images did stephen meanwhile perceive reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 cp a man lighting a candle of 1 cp a man removing in turn each of his two boots a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle did the man reappear elsewhere after a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor the halldoor turned gradually on its hinges in the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat with his candle did stephen obey his sign yes entering softly he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of bloom's house what did bloom do he extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone one

handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies grey hose with lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction what did bloom see on the range on the right smaller hob a blue enamelled saucepan on the left larger hob a black iron kettle what did bloom do at the range he removed the saucepan to the left hob rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow did it flow yes

system of relieving tanks by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at eustace bridge upper leeson street though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer mr spencer harty c e on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the grand and royal canals as in 1893 particularly as the south dublin guardians notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter had been convicted of a wastage of 20 000 gallons per night by a reading of their

fourpence and still unpaid for in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them face and hands in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller what reason did stephen give for declining bloom's offer that he was hydrophobe hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water his last bath having taken place in the month of october of the preceding year disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal distrusting aquacities of thought and language what impeded bloom from giving stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape stomach and thenar or sole of foot the incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius what additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress dietary concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon salt ling and butter the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest confidence in himself an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation what concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire the phenomenon of ebullition fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun primal source of heat radiant transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether heat convected a mode of motion developed by such combustion was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron in part reflected in part absorbed in part transmitted gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50 degrees to 212 degrees fahrenheit what announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature a double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously for what personal purpose could bloom have applied the water so boiled to shave himself what advantages attended shaving by night a softer beard a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours quiet reflections upon the course of the day a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises premonitions and perturbations a clattered milkcan a postman's double knock a paper read reread while lathering relathering the same spot a shock a shoot with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand what quality did it his hand possess but with what counteracting influence the operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means preferring in their natural order heliotherapy psychophysicotherapeutics osteopathic surgery what lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by bloom on the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups a

small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak on the upper shelf a battery of jamjars empty of various sizes and proveniences what attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets numbered 8 87 88 6 what reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow reminiscences of coincidences truth stranger than fiction preindicative of the result of the gold cup flat handicap the official and definitive result of which he had read in the evening telegraph late pink edition in the cabman's shelter at butt bridge where had previous intimations of the result effected or projected been received by him in bernard kiernan's licensed premises 8 9 and 10 little britain street in david byrne's licensed premises 14

street with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race graven in the language of prediction what qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations the difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation his mood he had not risked he did not expect he had not been disappointed he was satisfied what satisfied him to have sustained no positive loss to have brought a positive gain to others light to the gentiles how did bloom prepare a collation for a gentile he poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls four in all of epps's soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed what supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation crown derby presented to him by his only daughter millicent milly he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and in reduced measure to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife marion molly was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality his attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence epps's massproduct the creature cocoa were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun the reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side of his guest's jacket a gift to his guest of one of the four lady's handkerchiefs if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition who drank more quickly bloom having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted three sips to his opponent's one six to two nine to three what cerebration accompanied his frequentative act concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of william shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life had he found their solution in spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages aided by a glossary he had derived imperfect conviction from the text the answers not bearing in all points what lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him potential poet at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of 10/ 5/ and 2/6 respectively for competition by the shamrock a weekly newspaper an ambition to squint at my verses in print makes me hope that for these you'll find room if you so condescend then please place at the end the name of

sweet their praise divine let them hymn it nine times nine dearer far than song or wine you are mine the world is mine what had prevented him from completing a topical song music by r g johnston on

harlequinade by thomas otto and sung by nelly bouverist principal girl firstly oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest the anticipated diamond jubilee of queen victoria born 1820 acceded 1837 and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market secondly apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of york real and of his majesty king brian boru imaginary thirdly a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the grand lyric hall on burgh quay and the theatre royal in hawkins street fourthly distraction resultant from compassion for nelly bouverist's non intellectual non political non topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by nelly bouverist's revelations of white articles of non intellectual non political non topical underclothing while she nelly bouverist was in the articles fifthly the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from everybody's book of jokes 1000 pages and a laugh in every one sixthly the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous associated with the names of the new lord mayor daniel tallon the new high sheriff thomas pile and the new solicitorgeneral dunbar plunket barton what relation existed between their ages 16 years before in 1888 when bloom was of stephen's present age stephen was 6 16 years after in 1920 when stephen would be of bloom's present age bloom would be 54 in 1936 when bloom would be 70 and stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2 the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable conceiving that to be possible till then 1904 when stephen was 22 bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when stephen would be 38 as bloom then was bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714 would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age that of methusalah 969 years while if stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 a d bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83 300 years having been obliged to have been born in the year 81 396 b c what events might nullify these calculations the cessation of existence of both or either the inauguration of a new era or calendar the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species inevitable but impredictable how many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance two the first in the lilacgarden of matthew dillon's house medina villa kimmage road roundtown in 1887 in the company of stephen's mother stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation the second in the coffeeroom of breslin's hotel on a rainy sunday in the january of 1892 in the company of stephen's father and stephen's granduncle stephen being then 5 years older did bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father very gratefully with grateful appreciation with sincere appreciative gratitude in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret he declined did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them mrs riordan dante a widow of independent means had resided in the house of stephen's parents from 1 september 1888 to 29 december 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892 1893 and 1894 in the city arms hotel owned by elizabeth o'dowd of 54 prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of bloom who resided also in the same hotel being at that time a clerk in the employment of joseph cuffe of 5 smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent dublin cattle market on the north circular road had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her he had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings an infirm widow of independent if limited means in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the north circular road opposite mr gavin low's place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres hackney carriages tandems private and hired landaus dogcarts ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the phoenix park and vice versa why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without pedestrians quadrupeds velocipedes vehicles passing slowly quickly evenly round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe what distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased the older her bezique cards and counters her skye terrier her suppositious wealth her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness the younger her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the immaculate conception her green and maroon brushes for charles stewart parnell and for michael davitt her tissue papers were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable the indoor exercises formerly intermittently practised subsequently abandoned prescribed in eugen sandow's physical strength and how to obtain it which designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility had any special agility been his in earlier youth though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a high school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles did either openly allude to their racial difference neither what reduced to their simplest reciprocal form were bloom's thoughts about stephen's thoughts about bloom and about stephen's thoughts about bloom's thoughts about stephen he thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not what the enclosures of reticence removed were their respective parentages bloom only born male transubstantial heir of rudolf virag subsequently rudolph bloom of szombathely vienna budapest milan london and dublin and of ellen higgins second daughter of julius higgins born karoly and fanny higgins born hegarty stephen eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of simon dedalus of cork and dublin and of mary daughter of richard and christina goulding born grier had bloom and stephen been baptised and where and by whom cleric or layman bloom three times by the reverend mr gilmer johnston m a alone in the protestant church of saint nicholas without coombe by james o'connor philip gilligan and james fitzpatrick together under a pump in the village of swords and by the reverend charles malone c c in the church of the three patrons rathgar stephen once by the reverend charles malone c c alone in the church of the three patrons rathgar did they find their educational careers similar substituting stephen for bloom stoom would have passed successively through a dame's school and the high school substituting bloom for stephen blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory junior middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation first arts second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university why did bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to stephen or by stephen to him what two temperaments did they individually represent the scientific the artistic what proofs did bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied rather than towards pure science certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary for example the aeronautic parachute the reflecting telescope the spiral corkscrew the safety pin the mineral water siphon the canal lock with winch and sluice the suction pump were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten yes rendering obsolete popguns elastic airbladders games of hazard catapults they comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from aries to pisces miniature mechanical orreries arithmetical gelatine lozenges geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits globemap playing balls historically costumed dolls what also stimulated him in his cogitations the financial success achieved by ephraim marks and charles a james

receive this second part with mixed feelings unsmiling he heard and saw with wonder a jew's daughter all dressed in green condense stephen's commentary one of all the least of all is the victim predestined once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny it comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and as an apparition of hope and youth holds him unresisting it leads him to a strange habitation to a secret infidel apartment and there implacable immolates him consenting why was the host victim predestined sad he wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told why was the host reluctant unresisting still in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy why was the host secret infidel silent he weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder the incitations of the hierarchy the superstition of the populace the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity the envy of opulence the influence of retaliation the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism from which if any of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune from hypnotic suggestion once waking he had not recognised his sleeping apartment more than once waking he had been for an indefinite time incapable of

allusion to a local student faculty and year not stated did that first division portending a second division afflict him less than he had imagined more than he had hoped what second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently a temporary departure of his cat why similarly why differently similarly because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male mullingar student or of a healing herb valerian differently because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation in other respects were their differences similar in passivity

on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess what various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation for the guest security of domicile and seclusion of study for the host rejuvenation of intelligence vicarious satisfaction for the hostess disintegration of obsession acquisition of correct italian pronunciation why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's daughter because the way to daughter led through mother the way to mother through daughter to what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer if he had known the late mrs emily sinico accidentally killed at sydney parade railway station 14 october 1903

maternity hospital 29 30 and 31 holles street a public garden the vicinity of a place of worship a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences if both speakers were resident in different places what rendered problematic for bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions the irreparability of the past once at a performance of albert hengler's circus in the rotunda rutland square dublin an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where bloom solitary was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he bloom was his the clown's papa the imprevidibility of the future once in the summer of 1898 he bloom had marked a florin 2/ with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it m payment of an account due to and received by j and t davy family grocers 1 charlemont mall grand canal for circulation on the waters of civic finance for possible circuitous or direct return was the clown bloom's son no had bloom's coin returned never why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity he believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible eliminating these conditions there remained the generic conditions imposed by natural as distinct from human law as integral parts of the human whole the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence the agonies of birth and death the monotonous menstruation of simian and particularly human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause inevitable accidents at sea in mines and factories certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations innate lunacy and congenital criminality decimating epidemics catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions the fact of vital growth through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay why did he desist from speculation because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed did stephen participate in his dejection he affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void was this affirmation apprehended by bloom not verbally substantially what comforted his misapprehension that as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void in what order of precedence with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected lighted candle in stick borne by bloom diaconal hat on ashplant borne by stephen with what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm the 113th modus peregrinus in exitu israel de egypto domus jacob de populo barbaro what did each do at the door of egress bloom set the candlestick on the floor stephen put the hat on his head for what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress for a cat what spectacle confronted them when they first the host then the guest emerged silently doubly dark from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden the heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit with what meditations did bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations meditations of evolution increasingly vaster of the moon invisible in incipient lunation approaching perigee of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth of sirius alpha in canis maior 10 lightyears 57 000 000 000 000 miles distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet of arcturus of the precession of equinoxes of orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in 1901 of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years threescore and ten of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth beneath removable stones in hives and mounds of microbes germs bacteria bacilli spermatozoa of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies each in continuity its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till if the progress were carried far enough nought nowhere was never reached why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places e g the 9th power of the 9th power of 9 that the result having been obtained 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units tens hundreds thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions tens of millions hundreds of millions billions the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race given in species and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer easier of solution of a different order of difficulty conscious that the human organism normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage impeded respiration and vertigo when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under martian mercurial veneral jovian saturnian neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity and the problem of possible redemption the minor was proved by the

wind transit of shadow taciturnity of winged creatures emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals persistence of infernal light obscurity of terrestrial waters pallor of human beings his bloom's logical conclusion having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error that it was not a heaventree not a heavengrot not a heavenbeast not a heavenman that it was a utopia there being no known method from the known to the unknown an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space remobilised in air a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters it seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy the lake of dreams the sea of rains the gulf of dews the ocean of fecundity what special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations her nocturnal

motion and her presence the admonition of her craters her arid seas her silence her splendour when visible her attraction when invisible what visible luminous sign attracted bloom's who attracted stephen's gaze in the second storey rere of his bloom's house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by frank o'hara window blind curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer 16 aungier street how did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person his wife marion molly bloom denoted by a visible splendid sign a lamp with indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations with subdued affection and admiration with description with impediment with suggestion both then were silent silent each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces were they indefinitely inactive at stephen's suggestion at bloom's instigation both first stephen then bloom in penumbra urinated their sides contiguous their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition their gazes first bloom's then stephen's elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow similarly the trajectories of their first sequent then simultaneous urinations were dissimilar bloom's longer less irruent in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at high school 1880 had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution 210 scholars stephen's higher more sibilant who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure what different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other to bloom the problems of irritability tumescence rigidity reactivity dimension sanitariness pilosity to stephen the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of jesus circumcised i january holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce the carnal bridal ring of the holy roman catholic apostolic church conserved in calcata were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails what celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed a star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from vega in the lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the tress of berenice towards the zodiacal sign of leo how did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer by inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left withdrawing a bolt from its staple pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress how did they take leave one of the other in separation standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base the lines of their valedictory arms meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles what sound accompanied the union of their tangent the disunion of their respectively centrifugal and centripetal hands the sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of saint george what echoes of that sound were by both and each heard by stephen liliata rutilantium turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat by bloom heigho heigho heigho heigho where were the several members of the company which with bloom that day at the bidding of that

henry menton in bed bernard corrigan in bed patsy dignam in bed paddy dignam in the grave alone what did bloom hear the double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth the double

solar disk had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena once in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of luke doyle kimmage he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon seated on a wall his gaze turned in the direction of mizrach the east he remembered the initial paraphenomena more active air a matutinal distant cock ecclesiastical clocks at various points avine music the isolated tread of an early wayfarer the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon did he remain with deep inspiration he returned retraversing the garden reentering the passage reclosing the door with brief suspiration he reassumed the candle reascended the stairs reapproached the door of the front room hallfloor and reentered what suddenly arrested his ingress the right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa the walnut sideboard a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table describe them one a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere which repelled in recoil had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration the other a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves placed directly opposite the former its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush what significances attached to these two chairs significances of similitude of posture of symbolism of circumstantial evidence of testimonial supermanence what occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard a vertical piano cadby with exposed keyboard its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes its musicrest supporting the music in the key of g natural for voice and piano of love's old sweet song words by g clifton bingham composed by j l molloy sung by madam antoinette sterling open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum forte pedal animato sustained pedal ritirando close with what sensations did bloom contemplate in rotation these objects with strain elevating a candlestick with pain feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence with attention focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active with solicitation bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe with amusement remembering dr malachi mulligan's scheme of colour containing the gradation of green with pleasure repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration his next proceeding from an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone one inch in height placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus illustrated entitled agendath netaim unfolded the same examined it superficially rolled it into a thin cylinder ignited it in the candleflame applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion what followed this operation the truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense what homothetic objects other than the candlestick stood on the mantelpiece a timepiece of striated connemara marble stopped at the hour of 4 46 a m on the 21 march 1896 matrimonial gift of matthew dillon a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle an embalmed owl matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper what interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and bloom in the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl before the mirror the matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded bloom while bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle what composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention the image of a solitary ipsorelative mutable aliorelative man why solitary ipsorelative brothers and sisters had he none yet that man's father was his grandfather's son why mutable aliorelative from infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix from maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator what

copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism passive but not

issue deceased 9 january 1894 aged 11 days there remained a period of 10 years 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete without ejaculation of semen within the natural

indicated by catamenic hemorrhage of the female issue of narrator and listener 15 september 1903 there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which in consequence of a preestablished natural

bed of all the auks of the rocs of darkinbad the brightdayler where yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the city arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot mrs riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first god help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice i hope ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about mr riordan here and mr riordan there i suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still i like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but i suppose id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was o tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf mountain the day i wore that dress miss stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it hynes kept me who did i meet ah yes i met do you remember menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface i saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at pooles myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes i ever met and thats called a solicitor only for i hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when i came into the front room to show him dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that i care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that mary we had in ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice i had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when i found the long hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but i was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but i told her what i thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters i found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave her her weeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt i gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i couldnt even touch him if i thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the tolka in my hand there steals another i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im dining out and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some nicelooking boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id confuse him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him i know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when i was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german emperor is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then i hate that confession when i used to go to father corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar i wonder did he know me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats i tasted once with my finger dipped out of that american that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful thunderbolts in gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that evening in whitefriars street chapel for the month of may see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye i had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it jesusjack the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or i dont know what supposing i risked having another not off him though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good i know they were spooning a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything i was fuming with myself after for giving in only for i knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said he was he annoyed me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that i pretended i had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me the present of byron's poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he refused to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out i kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case i let out too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord byron i said i liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of laughing with the giggles i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married i wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for 10000 pounds for a postcard u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that id rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs maybrick that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged o she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when i was in the d b c with poldy laughing and trying to listen i was waggling my foot we both ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was what do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one i did i forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that i never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times lost in the ladies lavatory d b c dame street finder return to mrs marion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because i was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend once with my foot the night after goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung i could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i could give 9 points in 10 to katty lanner and beat her what does that mean i asked him i forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the lucan dairy thats so polite i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was tasting the butter so i took my time bartell darcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after i sang gounods ave maria what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see anything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was lo times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when milly and i were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till i took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket o maria santisima he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat i had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if i didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have i offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool henny doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an unlucky man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then i wrote the night he kissed my heart at dolphins barn i couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like gardner i hope hell come on monday as he said at the same time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface goodwin called about the concert in lombard street and i just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor i had to say im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today i thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and i was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when i knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was l/4 after 3 when i saw the 2 dedalus girls coming from school i never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly id want to get it looked after when i threw the penny to that lame sailor for england home and beauty when i was whistling there is a charming girl i love and i hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to belfast just as well he has to go to ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed i couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the mallow concert at maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him o i love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions i wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well o i suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to howth id like to find out something about him l or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose i never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert i sang at where its over a year ago when was it st teresas hall clarendon st little chits of missies they have now singing kathleen kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for lord roberts when i had the map of it all and poldy not irish enough was it him managed it this time i wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the stabat mater by going around saying he was putting lead kindly light to music i put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them sinner fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all i can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott i hate the mention of their politics after the war that pretoria and ladysmith and bloemfontein where gardner lieut stanley g 8th bn 2nd east lancs rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me im sure he was brave too he said i was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom paul and the rest of the other old krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love to see a regiment pass in review the first time i saw the spanish cavalry at la roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the black watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of wales own or the lancers o the lancers theyre grand or the dublins that won tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in belfast after what i gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things i must buy a mothball like i had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find out whether he likes me i looked a bit washy of course when i looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way mrs mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly well off i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at dessert when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made them that andalusian singing her manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear i could have brought them back to lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets id want advertised cheap in the gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from orourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to him 111 know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose 111 only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/ in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill lash it around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes how much were they ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more i have of life up to 35 no im what am i at all 111 be 33 in september will i what o well look at that mrs galbraith shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like kitty oshea in grantham street 1st thing i did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the day before we left and that mrs langtry the jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master francois somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page 5 o the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the crib at inchicore in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in mr cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly mrs bloom only i felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to todd and bums as i said and not lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash i hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if i went by his advices every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in grafton street i had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mrs bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you were yes i think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them i had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing ill get him to keep that up and ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when i was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the queens own they were a nice lot its well the surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed outside the mens greenhouse near the harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was i of the 7 wonders of the world o and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with poldy after the comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery i went into r of them it was so biting cold i couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero i tried to draw a picture of it before i tore it up like a sausage or something i wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said i could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in holles street when he lost the job in helys and i was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would i be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or im a little like that dirty bitch in that spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that i asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple i had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the citrons penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for i snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor brady to give me the belladonna prescription i had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything i declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if i only could remember the i half of the things and write a book out of it the works of master poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant i had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman i can feel his mouth o lord i must stretch myself i wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that i feel all fire inside me or if i could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger i was coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him i had to hug him after o lord i wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank god some of them want you to be so nice about it i noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk i gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute thursday friday one saturday two sunday three o lord i cant wait till monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today im glad i burned the half of those old freemans and photo bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the w c 111 get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last januarys paper and all those old overcoats i bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep i thought it was going to get like gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their 3 rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend mrs stanhope sent me from the b marche paris what a shame my dearest doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other

down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at la linea when that matador gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why i was afraid when that other ferocious old bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses i never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever i suppose theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old i made the scones of course i had everything all to myself then a girl hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when i put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was i then the night of the storm i slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the alameda esplanade when i was with father and captain grove i looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met i felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing i remember after when i looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like thomas in the shadow of ashlydyat i had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose i didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but i could have stopped it in time she gave me the moonstone to read that was the first i read of wilkie collins east lynne i read and the shadow of ashlydyat mrs henry wood henry dunbar by that other woman i lent him afterwards with mulveys photo in it so as he see i wasnt without and lord lytton eugene aram molly bawn she gave me by mrs hungerford on account of the name i dont like books with a molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it o this blanket is too heavy on me thats better i havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better i used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when i stood up they were so fattish and firm when i got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets i couldnt read a line lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never i remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious i had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt i cry yes i believe i did or near it my lips were taittering when i said goodbye she had a gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went i was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general ulysses grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain groves and father talking about rorkes drift and plevna and sir garnet wolseley and gordon at khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when i was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along i suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few i posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes i could fight with my nails listening to that old arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriments on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in holles street the nurse was after when i put on my gloves and hat at the window to show i was going out not a notion what i meant arent they thick never understand

where does their great intelligence come in id like to know grey matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the city arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear madam only his letter

write to the fellow that was something in the four courts that jilted her after out of the ladies letterwriter when i told her to say a few simple words he could twist how he liked not acting with precipat precip itancy with equal candour the greatest earthly happiness answer to a gentlemans proposal affirmatively my goodness theres nothing else its all very fine for them but as for being a woman as soon as youre old they might as well throw you out in the bottom of the ashpit mulveys was the first when i was in bed that morning and mrs rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when i asked her to hand me and i pointing at them i couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a loo her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the union jack flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken english sailors took all the rock from them and because i didnt run into mass often enough in santa maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on easter sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his majestad an admirer he signed it i near jumped out of my skin i wanted to pick him up when i saw him following me along the calle real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but i never thought hed write making an appointment i had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing i remember shall i wear a white rose and i wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young i put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did i tell him i was engaged for for fun to the son of a spanish nobleman named don miguel de la flora and he believed me that i was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things i told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the spanish girls he didnt like i suppose one of them wouldnt have him i got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till i taught him cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left may yes it was may when the infant king of spain was born im always like that in the spring id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near oharas tower i told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old barbary apes they sent to clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back mrs rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me i had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as i could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump i said i was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place i suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and saint michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there i was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had i could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but i wouldnt lee him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after i tried with the banana but i was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes o yes i pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but i opened my legs i wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because i had a skirt opening up the side i tormented the life out of him first tickling him i loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same i liked him like that moaning i made him blush a little when i got over him that way when i unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them molly darling he called me what was his name jack joe harry mulvey was it yes i think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so i went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back lord its just like yesterday to me and if i was married hed do it to me and i promised him yes faithfully id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20 years if i said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who i might recognise him hes young still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what i did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the chronicle i was a bit wild after when i blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from benady bros and exploded it lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the hebrew on them i wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as i settled it straight h m s calypso swinging my hat that old bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers god send him sense and me more money i suppose theyre called after him i never thought that would be my name bloom when i used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige m bloom youre looking blooming josie used to say after i married him well its better than breen or briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them mrs ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom mulvey i wouldnt go mad about either or suppose i divorced him mrs boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the lord knows after the lovely one she had lunita laredo the fun we had running along williss road to europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs i loved looking down at them i was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to india he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere i went up windmill hill to the flats that sunday morning with captain rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board i wore that frock from the b marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining i could see over to morocco almost the bay of tangier white and the atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear harry molly darling i was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks i kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that gibraltar only that cheap peau despagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else i wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy claddagh ring for luck that i gave gardner going to south africa where those boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour marie the marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was gardner yes i can

gibraltar even getting up to see why am i so damned nervous about that though i like it in the winter its more company o lord it was rotten cold too that winter when i was only about ten was i yes i had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift i had up to heat myself i loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and i in my skin hopping around i used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance i put out the light too so then there were 2 of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow i hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and findon haddy and hot buttered toast i suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and i love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake i wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but i hate their claws i wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as i wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh place i bought i think ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it friday yes i will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the london and newcastle williams and woods goes twice as far only for the bones i hate those eels cod yes ill get a nice piece of cod im always getting enough for 3 forgetting anyway im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5/ each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who mrs fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow i hate those ruck of mary ann coalboxes out for the day whit monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap i dont know who he is with that other beauty burke out of the city arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats 1 consolation i wonder what kind is that book he brought me sweets of sin by a gentleman of fashion some other mr de kock i suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another i couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat i had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old luigi near a hundred they said came from genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings i dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at i suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides i dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night i suppose ill have to put up with it i never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but i saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns o how nice i said whatever i liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in lloyds weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from i couldnt rest easy till i bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure i heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows still its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all is at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im certain the way he plots and plans everything out i couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless i bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when i put the chair against the door just as i was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that i got that little italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him i suppose he thinks im finished out and laid on the shelf well im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with tom devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of murray girls calling for her can milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in nelson street riding harry devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose i smelt it off her dress when i was biting off the thread of the button i sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i tell you only i oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the only way in the theatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching me afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the gaiety for beerbohm tree in trilby the last time ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft i think i saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside switzers window at the same little game i recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the broadstone going away well i hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way i did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet i never came properly till i was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that conny connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and supper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to put her hair up at i s my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way i was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when i asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met mrs joe gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till i gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting i was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or i didnt sleep the night before cheese i ate was it and i told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith i will that was the last time she turned on the teartap i was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am i ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old mrs fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job i found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser i knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially simon dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us i wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head i ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat i told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her ill have to hunt around again for someone every day i get up theres some new thing on sweet god sweet god well when im stretched out dead in my grave i suppose 111 have some peace i want to get up a minute if im let wait o jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am i to do friday saturday sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do god knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that michael gunn gave him to see mrs kendal and her husband at the gaiety something he did about insurance for him in drimmies i was fit to be tied though i wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about spinoza and his soul thats dead i suppose millions of years ago i smiled the best i could all in a swamp leaning forward as if i was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag i wont forget that wife of scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted i suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it i wish he had what i had then hed boo i bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what o patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is i dont want to ruin the clean sheets i just put on i suppose the clean linen i wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply o jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens i suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till i suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom i wonder is it nicer in the day i think it is easy i think ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me i might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode i wonder was i too heavy sitting on his knee i made him sit on the easychair purposely when i took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me i hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy god i remember one time i could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy o lord how noisy i hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow 111 have to perfume it in the morning dont forget i bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy god i wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman o lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy o how the waters come down at lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have i something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last i whit monday yes its only about 3 weeks i ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before i married him when i had that white thing coming from me and floey made me go to that dry old stick dr collins for womens diseases on pembroke road your vagina he called it i suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right i wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what i did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if i smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments i suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the rock of gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it i suppose i always used to know by millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had i frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways i wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap o anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my precious one everything connected with your glorious body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and i said i hadnt are you sure o yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him up i knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me i dont know how the first night ever we met when i was living in rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about lo minutes as if we met somewhere i suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the doyles said he was going to stand for a member of parliament o wasnt i the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the huguenots to sing in french to be more classy o beau pays de la touraine that i never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the albion milk and sulphur soap i used to use and the gelatine still round it o i laughed myself sick at him that day i better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it i suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god he took me to show one wet sunday in the museum in kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and our lords both put together all over asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes i know i hope the old press doesnt creak ah i knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her o this nuisance of a thing i hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up god help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old cohen i suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from lord napier that i used to admire when i was a little girl because i told him easy piano o i like my bed god here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all raymond terrace and ontario terrace and lombard street and holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the city arms hotel worse and worse says warden daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it thoms and helys and mr cuffes and drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the freeman too like the rest on account of those sinner fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers i saw on him wait theres georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour l wait 2 oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first ill look at his shirt to see or ill see if he has that french letter still in his pocketbook i suppose he thinks i dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the aristocrats masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs i suppose im nothing any more when i wouldnt let him lick me in holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so i thought i stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or i dont know what he forgets that wethen i dont ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles i wonder was it her josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and boylan though as for her denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when i was with him with milly at the college races that hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down i tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of mr paddy dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black l boom and tom kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens w c drunk in some place or other and martin cunningham and the two dedaluses and fanny mcoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day i see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially jack power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if i can help it making fun of him then behind his back i know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor paddy dignam all the same im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting bill bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the glencree dinner and ben dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/ in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and simon dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when i sang maritana with him at freddy mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice phoebe dearest goodbye sweet heart sweetheart he always sang it not like bartell darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath o maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to may goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the kingsbridge station with his father and mother i was in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me i heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat i suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when i saw him at mat dillons he liked me too i remember they all do wait by god yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before i thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord byron and not an ounce of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 i was married 88 milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at dillons 5 or 6 about 88 i suppose hes 20 or more im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 i hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from tarifa the lighthouse at europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and billy prescotts ad and keyess ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men i could see down in margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought i could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face i would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men i suppose never dream of washing it from i years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure itll be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till i see if the wishcard comes out or ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because i didnt call him hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of julius caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of marrowbone lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing i suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent i atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could i only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the love of mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great suggester don poldo de la flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket i knitted crying as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting god knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar delapaz delagracia they had the devils queer names there father vilaplana of santa maria that gave me the rosary rosales y oreilly in the calle las siete revueltas and pisimbo and mrs opisso in governor street o what a name id go and drown myself in the first river if i had a name like her o my and all the bits of streets paradise ramp and bedlam ramp and rodgers ramp and crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if i am a harumscarum i know i am a bit i declare to god i dont feel a day older than then i wonder could i get my tongue round any of the spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see i havent forgotten it all i thought i had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity i never tried to read that novel cantankerous mrs rubio lent me by valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in abrines i could do the criada the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for i he can make it for 2 im sure im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that i badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 ill just give him one more chance ill get up early in the morning im sick of cohens old bed in any case i might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning mamy dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when i used to be in the longing way then ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger i suppose hed like my nice cream too i know what ill do ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta masetto then ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is i s l o fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet i wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless i made him stand there and put him into me ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if i am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said o much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears god knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it i suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or he wouldnt have made us the way he did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then ill tell him i want li or perhaps 30/ ill tell him i want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad i dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do i could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers o i suppose that cant be helped ill do the indifferent l or 2 questions ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back i know every turn in him ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then ill suggest about yes o wait now sonny my turn is coming ill be quite gay and friendly over it o but i was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then ill go out ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour i suppose theyre just getting up in china now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if i can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only i only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as i can get up early ill go to lambes there beside findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today i mean no no fridays an unlucky day first i want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it i think while im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes i can accompany him first i must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll i wear shall i

nice plant for the middle of the table id get that cheaper in wait wheres this i saw them not long ago i love flowers id love to have the whole place swimming in roses god of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no god i wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something i often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes i know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do i so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day i got him to propose to me yes first i gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my god after that long kiss i near lost my breath yes he said i was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why i liked him because i saw he understood or felt what a woman is and i knew i could always get round him and i gave him all the pleasure i could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and i wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky i was thinking of so many things he didnt know of mulvey and mr stanhope and hester and father and old captain groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and i say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the greeks and the jews and the arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of europe and duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside larby sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and o that awful deepdown torrent o and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and gibraltar as a girl where i was a flower of the mountain yes when i put the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used or shall i wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the moorish wall and i thought well as well him as another and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower and first i put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes i will yes trieste zurich paris 1914 1921
